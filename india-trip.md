### Day 8: Thu Apr 3 (3 days to go)

> ‚ÄúFiction is the lie through which we tell the truth.‚Äù --- Albert Camus

Watched _The Order_ last night.

It was entertaining in a ‚Äúdiscount Harry Potter meets secret society‚Äù kind of way. A fun watch, but nothing that‚Äôll haunt my dreams or 
make me rethink my life choices.

Naturally, staying up for that masterpiece meant I was running on spiritual energy and caffeine fumes today. Had to tap out in the afternoon 
and take a nap---essentially a reboot with soft jazz and pillow drool.

Meanwhile, Shihan is still deep in his ISL training montage. Four more hours today!  He‚Äôs also tackling Putnam problems like a champ. 
The math gods are pleased.

On the research front, Shihan shifted focus to Project *G*, since Arun is currently bench-pressing Project *A* on his own. It still seems reasonable
to hope that the paper for _A_ will be finished in some form by April 7! ü§û Project *G*, on the other hand, is being a proper villain to Shihan's superhero
---offering just the right level of resistance to be worthy of his considerable gifts.

Shihan also had a Discord chat with Schettler---like all good modern scholars do.  Schettler mentioned that AMM says the paper is ‚ÄúIn review.‚Äù Which is 
academic code for: ¬Ø\\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø. Obviously, no clue as to how long it will take from here for a decision to be made and communicated. Now we wait in silence 
like monks with WiFi.

We had pre-decided yesterday that Inchin‚Äôs was going to be our dinner holy land, so we skipped lunch in solemn anticipation. Shihan did manage to sneak in 
his ‚Äúroyal‚Äù breakfast---you know what that means. I treated myself to a **hot** *Philharmonic* from Philz after what felt like a decade. It felt like 
coming home, if home were slightly overpriced and extremely caffeinated. 

Today‚Äôs walk turned into a surprisingly deep TED Talk. We discussed the different categories of communication: (1) respond instantly or risk guilt 
forever, (2) respond when Mercury is in retrograde, and (3) pretend it never arrived. Also talked about Big Picture college agendas---interspersed, 
of course, with wisecracks, hypotheticals, and at least one impersonation of a confused academic.

And then‚ÄîInchin‚Äôs!

The menu: Chinese bhel, momos, and American chopsuey with three sunny-side-up eggs just chilling on the side, living their best lives. 
Masala lime sodas at hand. Everything was delicious and the service was classy in that ‚Äúyou forget they‚Äôre even there‚Äù way.

As we basked in post-dinner glow, Shihan turned to me and asked the real question: ‚ÄúDo you think we‚Äôre having a better time... or is Mom?‚Äù

Existential, I know. I‚Äôm still thinking about it.

> "Stories you read when you're the right age never quite leave you. You may forget who wrote them or what the story was called.
Sometimes you'll forget precisely what happened, but if a story touches you it will stay with you, haunting the places in your mind
that you rarely ever visit." <br> --- Neil Gaiman, M Is for Magic


### Day 7: Wed Apr 2 (4 days to go)

> Spring is in the air ... wait, no, it's just pollen.

My allergies are in full rebellion --- I am sneezing like a malfunctioning sprinkler, sniffling like a sad movie character, and my eyes? 
Let‚Äôs just say they‚Äôve gone full "red-eyed Sith Lord" mode.  üòß ‚òπÔ∏è üò¨

Thank you so much üòö for the UNIQLO shirts. I can sneeze into them in style. 

I finally replaced our rainbow-colored cutting mats. The old ones had seen too much---battle scars, exhaustion, probably some existential crises. 
The new ones arrived today, looking all fresh and vibrant, so I did what had to be done: tossed the old ones into a well-earned retirement.

Started reading _James_ at last! 

> "Way I sees it is dis. If'n ya gots to hab a rule to tells ya wha's good, if'n ya gots to hab good 'splained to ya, den ya cain't be good.
If‚Äôn ya need sum kinda God to tells ya right from wrong, den you won't never know." <br> --- Percival Everett, James

It's a fun ride so far. Have you already finished it? If so, I expect a full book club analysis, preferably with 
dramatic reenactments.

Meanwhile, Shihan has been grinding ISL. Today‚Äôs highlight though? A lengthy discussion (read: lecture) on violin lessons. Honestly, I feel like 
he does not have any aspirations from it and is just going through the motions; and if that‚Äôs the case, I‚Äôm ready to cut the cord. Told him he 
needs to convince me why we should keep investing time and money into this. Debate scheduled for June 1. Also, if his scores keep tanking, that 
deadline might get ... expedited.

Went for a lovely walk today---perfect weather, good company, and deep discussions about the truly important things in life: tennis and soccer 
and such.
