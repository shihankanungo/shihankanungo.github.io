## Day 1: Thu Mar 27

Shihan is already bereft the moment we step inside the house, having dropped off his beloved mama at the airport. 
A few minutes later, he recovers enough to pull off an inredibly virtuosic violin practice session. I am seriously w-o-w-e-d.

It is 430PM: we are getting _chicken samosas_ from **Zareen's** as a snack. Might order pizza for dinner.
