### Day 9: Fri Apr 4 (2 days to go)

Shihan has **Physics Bowl** at Gunn HS at 130PM. 

Ilsa will be coming. 

I will also be taking Shihan to Stanford for a talk on Probability. 

Jesse Geneson has postponed his weekly meeting with Shihan to Sunday 6PM.

Arun has called for a meeting over the weekend; possibly Saturday morning. 

We are planning to go to _Casa Lupe_ for lunch.

Stay tuned for updates.

### Day 8: Thu Apr 3 (3 days to go)

> “Fiction is the lie through which we tell the truth.” --- Albert Camus

Watched _The Order_ last night.

It was entertaining in a “discount Harry Potter meets secret society” kind of way. A fun watch, but nothing that’ll haunt my dreams or 
make me rethink my life choices.

Naturally, staying up for that masterpiece meant I was running on spiritual energy and caffeine fumes today. Had to tap out in the afternoon 
and take a nap---essentially a reboot with soft jazz and pillow drool.

Meanwhile, Shihan is still deep in his ISL training montage. Four more hours today!  He’s also tackling Putnam problems like a champ. 
The math gods are pleased.

On the research front, Shihan shifted focus to Project *G*, since Arun is currently bench-pressing Project *A* on his own. It still seems reasonable
to hope that the paper for _A_ will be finished in some form by April 7! 🤞 Project *G*, on the other hand, is being a proper villain to Shihan's superhero
---offering just the right level of resistance to be worthy of his considerable gifts.

Shihan also had a Discord chat with Schettler---like all good modern scholars do.  Schettler mentioned that AMM says the paper is “In review.” Which is 
academic code for: ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯. Obviously, no clue as to how long it will take from here for a decision to be made and communicated. Now we wait in silence 
like monks with WiFi.

We had pre-decided yesterday that Inchin’s was going to be our dinner holy land, so we skipped lunch in solemn anticipation. Shihan did manage to sneak in 
his “royal” breakfast---you know what that means. I treated myself to a **hot** *Philharmonic* from Philz after what felt like a decade. It felt like 
coming home, if home were slightly overpriced and extremely caffeinated. 

Today’s walk turned into a surprisingly deep TED Talk. We discussed the different categories of communication: (1) respond instantly or risk guilt 
forever, (2) respond when Mercury is in retrograde, and (3) pretend it never arrived. Also talked about Big Picture college agendas---interspersed, 
of course, with wisecracks, hypotheticals, and at least one impersonation of a confused academic. Here's a nugget:
> There are two types of people who use statistics: liars, and outliers!! --- Shihan

And then—Inchin’s!

The menu: Chinese bhel, momos, and American chopsuey with three sunny-side-up eggs just chilling on the side, living their best lives. 
Masala lime sodas at hand. Everything was delicious and the service was classy in that “you forget they’re even there” way.

As we basked in post-dinner glow, Shihan turned to me and asked the real question: “Do you think we’re having a better time... or is Mom?”

Existential, I know. I’m still thinking about it.
