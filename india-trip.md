## Shenanigans

### Day 5: Mon Mar 31 (6 days to go)

How was Eid? What was on the menu?

Shihan has his violin lesson with Mr. Law. Then after, I will take him to Stanford for a talk on Probability.

SJSU is on hiatus --- this week is spring break.

Arun has made significant progress on the rewrite. Shihan is also picking up the mantle. 


### Day 4: Sun Mar 30 (7 days to go)

Men’s Final of the Miami Open Masters 1000: Djokovic vs. Jakub Mensik at 12PM PT. 
The battle of the ages vs. the fresh-faced upstart --- tennis or an HBO drama? You decide.

I’ve been ordering iced coffee from Philz ever since you left. It’s pretty good, and also, no memories attached --- 
since you have always preferred your drinks hot, not cold. 

Shihan is plotting a brunch heist at _Sun of Wolf_, targeting the _chilaquiles_.

Tragically, this means we won't be visiting _Olympus_. 

Post-brunch, Shihan expressed a desire to "_experience the Farmer’s Market_." I magnanimously gave him $5 for this cultural expedition. 
He acquired 4 sticks of honey for $1 (an absolute steal) but then, in an unforeseen twist, begged me for an additional $6 to secure a 
_Black Forest_ pastry. As a shrewd negotiator, he offered to share in return. The boy is rapidly evolving into a seasoned dealmaker.  

Meanwhile, on Planet _A_ (read Project _A_), revision madness is at full throttle. Arun was burning the midnight oil (possibly the 3AM oil). 
A major structural overhaul is underway, making the paper infinitely better. I’m thrilled that Arun has found the time to wrestle this 
beast into shape, and dare I say, the deadline might actually be met. The paper itself will also be significantly improved.

Watched a movie last night: *The Trap.* It was bad. Like, “why did I do this to myself” bad. Originally planned to watch *Beginners* (2011), 
but then I realized you’d want to watch it with me, and I simply couldn’t betray our sacred movie pact.

Current musical obsessions:  
- **Carsie Blanton** \[ [YT](https://music.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL6HQpYuOe1KXm15iel1h8rZCf0eWvL8P-&si=9YNGkXfj6Gn988Jl) \] –-- Virginia-born, fled to Oregon at 16, turned pro, tried Philly, landed in New Orleans. Songs are catchy, quotable, clever, sometimes cute.  <br>
- **Kalie Shorr** \[ [YT](https://music.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL6HQpYuOe1KWqv28EcA8EAejIxaI8gdjg&si=iKKw7tontvssZABA) \] –-- Maine native, now in Nashville. Country-tinged but brash, loud, and probably rocks harder than any Nashville ingenue since Miranda Lambert.

Exciting development: My copy of *James* has arrived. Great things ahead.

The weather continues to be absurdly delightful. Another two walks today--at this rate, we’ll become professional strollers. 

Shihan, in his pre-bedtime melancholy, strummed the guitar absentmindedly. Seems to miss you a lot -- especially at night. The bedtime blues are real.
