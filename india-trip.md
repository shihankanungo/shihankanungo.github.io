## Shenanigans

### Day 3: Sat Mar 29 (8 days to go)

Shihan has managed to get a meeting out of Arun. They are meeting tomorrow (Sunday) at 6PM to discuss finishing touches for _A_. 
<br> Arun is hoping have this published **Algebras and Representation Theory**, another Q1 journal.

He has been working on _G_ this morning. Finished his Saturday morning chore of laundry.

We will be ordering Chipotle burrito bowls for lunch. I think that qualifies as _healthy_, in which case we have had not a single 
unhealthy meal since she left us in the Palo Alto wilderness to fend for ourselves. 

Shihan is missing you. I don't know if you noticed, but he was overjoyed that you asked to speak with him. I don't think he will 
even mind a Zoom call with your entire "real family" in attendance.

### Day 2: Fri Mar 28 (9 days to go)

Today is going to be a bustling day. Mainly the two PRIMES-USA projects: "_A_" for Arun's and "_G_" for Geneson's. 
Mostly finishing touches and Arun's approval for _A_. Shihan had a mini-breakthrough in _G_ which he will discuss 
with Geneson in his meeting later on in the evening. Promises to be exciting!

You will be landing in Dubai soon. In case you forgot, I had asked for 
> **BLEU DE CHANEL** _Parfum Spray_. 

Hope you are rested and not jet-lagged when you reach New Delhi. Remember to stay hydrated.

1PM: Just got back from lunch at _Casa Lupe_. Shihan remembered to change into his Snoopy watch, since we were "going out".
I had _camarones rancheros_ at Casa Lupe and Shihan had _crispy tacos_. It was fantastic!!
<br> Djokovic won the SF match against Dimitrov. He served phenomenally -- he did not miss a single first serve for the first 
40 minutes of the match. <br> Final on Sunday. Looking forward to it.

4PM: You must have reached New Delhi. How was immigration? When is your flight to Lucknow? Hope you are feeling ok.

5PM: Shihan had a wonderful violin session. He is now complaining that a single hour is too short. I told him that if he feels
the same way for a month then we can increase to 1.5 hours and do a bit less of SJSU coursework. Now looking forward to meeting
Geneson at 6PM. Shihan made yet another mini-breakthrough in _G_ so all the more exciting.
