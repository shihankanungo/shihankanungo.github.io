> Spring is in the air ... wait, no, it's just pollen.

My allergies are in full rebellion --- I am sneezing like a malfunctioning sprinkler, sniffling like a sad movie character, and my eyes? 
Let’s just say they’ve gone full "red-eyed Sith Lord" mode.  😧 ☹️ 😬

Thank you so much 😚 for the UNIQLO shirts. I can sneeze into them in style. 

I finally replaced our rainbow-colored cutting mats. The old ones had seen too much---battle scars, exhaustion, probably some existential crises. 
The new ones arrived today, looking all fresh and vibrant, so I did what had to be done: tossed the old ones into a well-earned retirement.

Started reading _James_ at last!

It's a fun ride so far. Have you already finished it? If so, I expect a full book club analysis, preferably with 
dramatic reenactments.

Meanwhile, Shihan has been grinding ISL. Today’s highlight though? A lengthy discussion (read: lecture) on violin lessons. Honestly, I feel like 
he does not have any aspirations from it and is just going through the motions; and if that’s the case, I’m ready to cut the cord. Told him he 
needs to convince me why we should keep investing time and money into this. Debate scheduled for June 1. Also, if his scores keep tanking, that 
deadline might get ... expedited.

Went for a lovely walk today---perfect weather, good company, and deep discussions about the truly important things in life: tennis and soccer 
and such.
