### Day 6: Tue Apr 1 (5 days to go)

> April Fool's Day! Here‚Äôs an interesting fact: In 1957, the **BBC pulled one of the most famous April Fool‚Äôs Day pranks** by airing a segment about the 
**Swiss Spaghetti Harvest.** The program showed Swiss farmers picking spaghetti from trees, claiming that a mild winter had led to a bumper crop. Viewers 
actually called in, asking how they could grow their own spaghetti trees! üçùüòÇ

It again rained today --- Shihan may have been onto something with his ‚Äúlet nature do the work‚Äù strategy re. the watering of mama's plants. A true visionary!

Big news: The "silver tube" from MIT arrived in the mail today!

Inside? An offer of admission, a fancy certificate that screams "frame me", and, of course, some confetti (because MIT knows how to party). 
Also included: a sticker, which, in a move of great decisiveness, was instantly slapped onto the Chromebook---no hesitation there, pure instinct. 
There was also a goofy-nerdy-scifi poster, presumably to remind us all that MIT is, in fact, MIT.

Shihan is back in ISL _grind mode_. Four hours today. The boy is locked in. But, alas, he is starved of celestial encouragement---he misses your stars. :(

We ordered fish and rice for lunch today, from _Da Sichuan Bistro_. Perhaps a smidgen of extra salt in the fish, but otherwise quite tasty and healthy.

Post-lunch, we took a walk. It was peaceful. We pondered the mysteries of life. Also of Kanye West, and Eminem, and Gracie. A well-rounded discussion. 
We could feel a few drops of rain as we got back home.

130PM: It is still raining. Shihan has assumed his philosopher-in-the-window pose, perched on the living room sill, allegedly working on PRIMES project _G_. 
He requested tea, to which I complied. Now, he sips his mint-ginger chai with an air of deep contemplation. Progress on _G_? Unclear. But the tea? 10/10.

Stay tuned for further developments.

### Day 5: Mon Mar 31 (6 days to go)

How was Eid? What was on the menu? <br> 
In our neck of the woods, it is today. We are getting _chicken biryani_ from Ettan. I don't know if any place has good sewain, so just gonna skip that. 

It rained today --- not monsoon yet, but enough for Shihan to confidently declare that he doesn't have to water Mama‚Äôs plants anymore. Seems a bold 
conclusion, and also entirely incorrect. 

Shihan had his violin lesson with Mr. Law. He got 8.9. He seemed a bit disappointed, but maintained that Mr. Law was unusually happy with his playing today.
After that, I took Shihan to a talk on Probability at Stanford. The biggest probability lesson of the evening? If you drag a kid to a math talk, the probability 
of them getting hungry immediately afterward is 100%. So, I ordered momos from _Everest Cuisine_, and oh boy --- those dumplings did **not** disappoint.

SJSU is on hiatus --- this week is spring break.

Arun is _crushing_ the rewrite. Shihan is also picking up the mantle --- seems to think the paper will be ready before the weekend.
