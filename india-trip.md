### Day 7: Wed Apr 2 (4 days to go)

> Spring is in the air ... wait, no, it's just pollen.

My allergies have been acting up big time. Lots of sneezing, sniffling, and irritation in the eyes. üòß ‚òπÔ∏è üò¨

Thank you so much üòö for the UNIQLO shirts.

### Day 6: Tue Apr 1 (5 days to go)

> **April Fool's Day!** <br> Here‚Äôs an interesting fact: In 1957, the **BBC pulled one of the most famous April Fool‚Äôs Day pranks** by airing a segment about the 
**Swiss Spaghetti Harvest.** The program showed Swiss farmers picking spaghetti from trees, claiming that a mild winter had led to a bumper crop. Viewers 
actually called in, asking how they could grow their own spaghetti trees! üçùüòÇ

It again rained today --- Shihan may have been onto something with his ‚Äúlet nature do the work‚Äù strategy re. the watering of mama's plants. A true visionary!

Big news: The "silver tube" from MIT arrived in the mail today!

Inside? An offer of admission, a fancy certificate that screams "frame me", and, of course, some confetti (because MIT knows how to party). 
Also included: a sticker, which, in a move of great decisiveness, was instantly slapped onto the Chromebook---no hesitation there, pure instinct. 
There was also a goofy-nerdy-scifi poster, presumably to remind us all that MIT is, in fact, MIT.

Shihan is back in ISL _grind mode_. Four hours today. The boy is locked in. But, alas, he is starved of celestial encouragement---he misses your stars. :(

We ordered fish and rice for lunch today, from _Da Sichuan Bistro_. Perhaps a smidgen of extra salt in the fish, but otherwise quite tasty and healthy.

Post-lunch, we took a walk. It was peaceful. We pondered the mysteries of life. Also of Kanye West, and Eminem, and Gracie. A well-rounded discussion. 
We could feel a few drops of rain as we got back home.

130PM: It is still raining. Shihan has assumed his philosopher-in-the-window pose, perched on the living room sill, allegedly working on PRIMES project _G_. 
He requested tea, to which I complied. Now, he sips his mint-ginger chai with an air of deep contemplation. Progress on _G_? Unclear. But the tea? 10/10.

We miss you like an idiot misses the point---pretty much all the time. üòÜ

Stay tuned for further updates.
