## Shenanigans

### Day 2: Fri Mar 28 (9 days to go)

Today is going to be a bustling day. Mainly the two PRIMES-USA projects: "_A_" for Arun's and "_G_" for Geneson's. 
Mostly finishing touches and Arun's approval for _A_. Shihan had a mini-breakthrough in _G_ which he will discuss 
with Geneson in his meeting later on in the evening. Promises to be exciting!

You will be landing in Dubai soon. In case you forgot, I had asked for 
> **BLEU DE CHANEL** _Parfum Spray_. 

Hope you are rested and not jet-lagged when you reach New Delhi. Remember to stay hydrated.

1PM: Just got back from lunch at _Casa Lupe_. Shihan remembered to change into his Snoopy watch, since we were "going out".
I had _camarones rancheros_ at Casa Lupe and Shihan had _crispy tacos_. It was fantastic!!
<br> Djokovic won the SF match against Dimitrov. He served phenomenally -- he did not miss a single first serve for the first 
40 minutes of the match. <br> Final on Sunday. Looking forward to it.

4PM: You must have reached New Delhi. How was immigration? When is your flight to Lucknow? Hope you are feeling ok.

5PM: Shihan had a wonderful violin session. He is now complaining that a single hour is too short. I told him that if he feels
the same way for a month then we can increase to 1.5 hours and do a bit less of SJSU coursework. Now looking forward to meeting
Geneson at 6PM. Shihan made yet another mini-breakthrough in _G_ so all the more exciting. 

### Day 1: Thu Mar 27 (10 days to go)

Shihan is already bereft the moment we step inside the house, having dropped off his beloved mama at the airport. 
A few minutes later, he recovers enough to pull off an inredibly virtuosic violin practice session. I am seriously w-o-w-e-d.

It is 430PM: UAE226/EK226 is about to take off; landing 740PM PT at Dubai. 
we are getting _chicken samosas_ from **Zareen's** as a snack. Might order pizza for dinner. Ended up getting _sweetgreen_ salads. 

Shihan is **obsessed** with his watch!!

630PM: finished dinner. shihan has brushed and changed and is now on his MPK Mini Plus. he is excited about sampling 
Phoebe Bridger's cover of Metallica's _Nothing Else Matters_. \[ [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/track/1guCON9841cQwAlbNplLsY?si=90152dbdb5b94e54) \]

8PM: Put Shihan to bed. He spent his entire bedtime admiring his watch. No reading or music today :) 
I will be watching tennis: Jessica Pegula plays Alex Eala, a teenager from Phillipines, in the SF of Miami Open. Earlier, Djokovic beat Korda to book
a spot in the Semi Final. 

1130PM: Going to bed. Pegula won! After the match I did some background reading on Shihan's PRIMES-USA project (the one with Arun). 
His paper looks really good!!
