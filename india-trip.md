## Shenanigans

### Day 4: Sun Mar 30 (7 days to go)

Men’s Final of the Miami Open Masters 1000: Djokovic vs. Jakub Mensik at 12PM PT. 
The battle of the ages vs. the fresh-faced upstart --- tennis or an HBO drama? You decide.

I’ve been ordering iced coffee from Philz ever since you left. It’s pretty good, and also, no memories attached --- 
since you have always preferred your drinks hot, not cold. 

Shihan is plotting a brunch heist at _Sun of Wolf_, targeting the _chilaquiles_.

Tragically, this means we won't be visiting _Olympus_. 

Post-brunch, Shihan expressed a desire to "_experience the Farmer’s Market_." I magnanimously gave him $5 for this cultural expedition. 
He acquired 4 sticks of honey for $1 (an absolute steal) but then, in an unforeseen twist, begged me for an additional $6 to secure a 
_Black Forest_ pastry. As a shrewd negotiator, he offered to share in return. The boy is rapidly evolving into a seasoned dealmaker.  

Meanwhile, on Planet _A_ (read Project _A_), revision madness is at full throttle. Arun was burning the midnight oil (possibly the 3AM oil). 
A major structural overhaul is underway, making the paper infinitely better. I’m thrilled that Arun has found the time to wrestle this 
beast into shape, and dare I say, the deadline might actually be met. The paper itself will also be significantly improved.

Watched a movie last night: *The Trap.* It was bad. Like, “why did I do this to myself” bad. Originally planned to watch *Beginners* (2011), 
but then I realized you’d want to watch it with me, and I simply couldn’t betray our sacred movie pact.

Current musical obsessions:  
- **Carsie Blanton** ([YT playlist](https://music.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL6HQpYuOe1KXm15iel1h8rZCf0eWvL8P-&si=9YNGkXfj6Gn988Jl)) –-- Virginia-born, fled to Oregon at 16, turned pro, tried Philly, landed in New Orleans. Songs are catchy, quotable, clever, sometimes cute.  <br>
- **Kalie Shorr** ([YT playlist](https://music.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL6HQpYuOe1KWqv28EcA8EAejIxaI8gdjg&si=iKKw7tontvssZABA)) –-- Maine native, now in Nashville. Country-tinged but brash, loud, and probably rocks harder than any Nashville ingenue since Miranda Lambert.

Exciting development: My copy of *James* has arrived. Great things ahead.

The weather continues to be absurdly delightful. Another two walks today--at this rate, we’ll become professional strollers. 

Shihan, in his pre-bedtime melancholy, strummed the guitar absentmindedly. Seems to miss you a lot -- especially at night. The bedtime blues are real.


### Day 3: Sat Mar 29 (8 days to go)

Shihan has managed to get a meeting out of Arun. They are meeting tomorrow (Sunday) at 6PM to discuss finishing touches for _A_. 
<br> Arun is hoping have this published in **Algebras and Representation Theory**, another Q1 journal.

**UPDATE:** Shihan has been pulling hostage-negotiation-shihanigans on Arun. Arun tried valiantly to wiggle out but Shihan
ruthlessly cornered him into yielding a deadline. Arun finally offered to get the paper ready by Apr 7. This is a HUGE win. 

Shihan has been working on _G_ this morning. He took care of his Saturday morning chore of laundry.

We will be ordering Chipotle burrito bowls for lunch. I'd say that qualifies as _healthy_, which means we haven’t had a single 
unhealthy meal since she left us to fend for ourselves in the Palo Alto wilderness.

Tennis: Jessica Pegula vs. Aryna Sabalenka in the Finals of the Miami Open Masters 1000! <br>
Sabalenka won. Djokovic plays tomorrow in the Men's Final.

1PM: Just got back from a very pleasant walk. The weather is incredible --- slight nip in the air, a gentle and crisp breeze, just
enough sunlight to make it pleasing, like a warm shower and incredible conversation. We are so fortunate to be living in such a 
beautiful neighborhood. Shihan is practicing violin now. 

**UPDATE:** <br>
5PM: The weather was so nice we went for a second walk. It was fantastic this time too!! <br>
We decided to have a late dinner at 7PM but when it was 7 Shihan said he would rather skip dinner. He did his music instead.
Shihan is cooking up some serious stuff on his MPK Mini Plus. 

Shihan is missing you. I'm not sure if you noticed, but he was overjoyed when you asked to speak with him. I doubt he will 
even mind a Zoom call with your entire "real family" in attendance.
