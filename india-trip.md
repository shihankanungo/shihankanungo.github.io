## Shenanigans

### Day 2: Fri Mar 28 (9 days to go)

Today is going to be a bustling day. Mainly the two PRIMES-USA projects. Finishing touches and Arun's approval for one and then meeting with
Geneson for the other. Shihan had a mini-breakthrough in the latter, so it is exciting!

### Day 1: Thu Mar 27 (10 days to go)

Shihan is already bereft the moment we step inside the house, having dropped off his beloved mama at the airport. 
A few minutes later, he recovers enough to pull off an inredibly virtuosic violin practice session. I am seriously w-o-w-e-d.

It is 430PM: UAE226/EK226 is about to take off; landing 740PM PT at Dubai. 
we are getting _chicken samosas_ from **Zareen's** as a snack. Might order pizza for dinner. Ended up getting _sweetgreen_ salads. 

Shihan is **obsessed** with his watch!!

630PM: finished dinner. shihan has brushed and changed and is now on his MPK Mini Plus. he is excited about sampling 
Phoebe Bridger's cover of Metallica's _Nothing Else Matters_. \[ [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/track/1guCON9841cQwAlbNplLsY?si=90152dbdb5b94e54) \]

8PM: Put Shihan to bed. He spent his entire bedtime admiring his watch. No reading or music today :) 
I will be watching tennis: Jessica Pegula plays Alex Eala, a teenager from Phillipines, in the SF of Miami Open. Earlier, Djokovic beat Korda to book
a spot in the Semi Final. 

1130PM: Going to bed. Pegula won! After the match I did some background reading on Shihan's PRIMES-USA project (the one with Arun). 
His paper looks really good!!
