## Shenanigans

### Day 6: Tue Apr 1 (5 days to go)

It again rained today --- Shihan might have been right after all, about not needing to water mama's plants. 

Shihan got "the silver tube" from MIT in the mail today.

It has the offer of admission and a very nice certificate/plaque that can be framed and put in
his study if you wish. It also had confetti, a sticker (which was immediately planted on the chromebook) and a poster. 

Shihan has resumed ISL prep. He did 4 hours today. He is missing your stars :(

We went for a walk after lunch. It was nice. We talked about life. Also about Kanye West, and Eminem, and Gracie.

### Day 5: Mon Mar 31 (6 days to go)

How was Eid? What was on the menu? <br> 
In our neck of the woods, it is today. We are getting _chicken biryani_ from Ettan. I don't know if any place has good sewain, so just gonna skip that. 

It rained today --- not monsoon yet, but enough for Shihan to confidently declare that he doesn't have to water Mamaâ€™s plants anymore. Seems a bold 
conclusion, and also entirely incorrect. 

Shihan had his violin lesson with Mr. Law. He got 8.9. He seemed a bit disappointed, but maintained that Mr. Law was unusually happy with his playing today.
After that, I took Shihan to a talk on Probability at Stanford. The biggest probability lesson of the evening? If you drag a kid to a math talk, the probability 
of them getting hungry immediately afterward is 100%. So, I ordered momos from _Everest Cuisine_, and oh boy --- those dumplings did **not** disappoint.

SJSU is on hiatus --- this week is spring break.

Arun is _crushing_ the rewrite. Shihan is also picking up the mantle --- seems to think the paper will be ready before the weekend.
