## Shenanigans

### Day 1: Thu Mar 27 (10 days to go)

Shihan is already bereft the moment we step inside the house, having dropped off his beloved mama at the airport. 
A few minutes later, he recovers enough to pull off an inredibly virtuosic violin practice session. I am seriously w-o-w-e-d.

It is 430PM: UAE226/EK226 is about to take off; landing 740PM PT at Dubai. 
we are getting _chicken samosas_ from **Zareen's** as a snack. Might order pizza for dinner. Ended up getting _sweetgreen_ salads. 

Shihan is **obsessed** with his watch!!

630PM: finished dinner. shihan has brushed and changed and is now on his MPK Mini Plus. he is excited about sampling 
Phoebe Bridger's cover of Metallica's _Nothing Else Matters_. \[ [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/track/1guCON9841cQwAlbNplLsY?si=90152dbdb5b94e54) \]
