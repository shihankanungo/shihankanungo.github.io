## Movies

### Recorded Music

At the start of the year, I had the noble idea of tracking every piece of music I listened to&mdash;like some kind of sonic librarian. It took approximately five minutes to realize this was a fool’s errand. Case in point: last year alone, I clocked 9,860 songs and over 100,000 minutes on Spotify. 

<p align="center"><img src="/images/spotify-24.png" width="500" /></p>

And that’s _just_ Spotify. Throw in CDs, YouTube rabbit holes, car rides, and my Bandcamp jazz benders, and suddenly it looks like I'm trying to inventory Niagara Falls with a teaspoon.

So, after a few weeks of valiant effort (and mild spreadsheet trauma), I threw in the towel. Going forward, I’ll just note the highlights: music that has sounded remarkable to me for one reason or another; songs that made me pause, perk up, or transported me to a strange, weird, fascinating world.

Next day, mom went out and stumbled upon the Farmer's Market, which she raved about for the rest of the trip and even after reaching home. The awards ceremony was excellent: the speeches were very good, particularly Prof. Tao's keynote address, and it was all arranged very professionally. At Mathfest, me and the other awardees were treated very specially: many people came up and introduced themselves to us. I chatted with **TZ** for a long-ish time.

We listened to some recruiting speeches and played a few games. Got a lot of swags -- a Sonos Roam speaker, t-shirts, Figgie. Went for dinner to *Oyster Bar* and then hung out for a bit by the water.

- **Cambridge, MA --- Oct 18--20**. MIT PRIMES October Conference. Very eventful trip. Started by missing the 825AM flight out of SFO. Got on the 1145AM one instead. It so happened that David's parents were on the same flight and sitting in the row just behind mine. Got an Uber from the Boston airport straight to *Himalayan Kitchen* for dinner, before driving to the hotel. Caught up with lots of friends both from Physics camp as well as from MOP. Got to spend a lot of time with TZ, WZ, SE. Ran into a *Cryptography* office hour (met HF and SR)! Caught up on ski/snowboard tea. Talk went well too. Watched *Forrest Gump* (or what was left of it from before). Went to *Cava* for lunch on Sunday. Repeat of *Ghana Bitter*" from Royce chocolates on Sat and Sun. Finished with dinner at *SSaanjh*. Overall, a most memorable trip.
- **Berkeley, CA --- Nov 8**. The Berkeley Math Tournament (BMT). It was so foggy during the drive to Berkeley in the morning. We listened to early *Rolling Stones* in the car. Was in *AlphaStar Saturn* with JD, EL, RB, MY, SR. We finished 5th overall and 3rd in Power Round. Other highlights: RB (4th Discrete), EL (7th Algebra), MY (10th Calculus) and myself (5th Geometry). *AlphaStar Mars* came second overall (they missed first place by 1 point. Also, *AlphaStar Mercury*, comprising entirely of middle schoolers, came in 5th in GUTS. Both teams were amazing!! Got done at 6PM. Had *dahi paapdi chaat* and *chicken kathi roll* from *Vik's Chaat* for dinner. Listened to *Olivia Dean* on the drive back home.
- **Princeton, NJ --- Nov 21--23**. The Princeton University Mathematics Competition (PUMaC). Halfway to SFO on Friday moring, I suddenly realized I didn’t have my wallet — which meant no ID — so we had to turn around and drive back home. That small hiccup set off a chain of minor mishaps, but eventually we made it onto UA 435 to Newark. We stayed at the *DoubleTree Hilton*, a very friendly and comfortable hotel. For dinner we ordered from *Cross Culture*: achari mutton and roti — absolutely delicious. Saturday was the contest itself. My performance was pretty meh, but the competition was extremely well organized, and I got to meet and catch up with several friends from MOP. Surprisingly, I wasn’t able to meet up with TZ, who had traveled all the way from MIT just to hang out with us in the evening.
I attended a talk by Jacob Tsimerman, and it was genuinely fantastic. I spoke with him briefly afterward &mdash; he was very approachable. After returning to the hotel with the AlphaStar coaches, I watched *Crazy Stupid Love* in the hotel room. Dinner was from *Mannat by Chef Gaurav Mathur*: paapdi chaat and kadhai goat with roti. As expected, it was amazing. We flew back home on Sunday, and I ended the trip with homemade biryani for lunch. All in all, an unexpectedly wonderful trip.
- **San Francisco, CA --- Nov 26**. *Chez Maman* &mdash; French style restaurant in Potrero Hills with a good atmoshere. Ordered *french onion soup*; veal in creamy white wine sauce, with vegetables and mushrooms; and baguette with butter on the side. Quite tasty, but a tad expensive for lunch. Picked up a whole chicken from *Saba Live Poultry* &mdash; for tomorrow's Thanksgiving roast dinner. Listened to two playlists while driving &mdash; *Love you (Like a Love Song)* [<a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/5WY9EXpwTsILouHQjIEAAQ?si=61f1157d7cb14ebd">Link</a>] on the way to SF and *(I'm) In Love* [<a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/1TMrh1H7P9xHuaElSi9lwy?si=cfcda3e8c99145ac">Link</a>] on the way back. Quite a fun outing.
