## Music 

> "People haven't always been there for me but music always has." --- Taylor Swift

<br>

## Books

> "What really knocks me out is a book that, when you're all done reading it, you wish the author that wrote it was a terrific friend of yours and you could call him up on the phone whenever you felt like it. That doesn't happen much, though." --- J.D. Salinger, *The Catcher in the Rye*
