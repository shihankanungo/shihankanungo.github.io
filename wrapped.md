## Math Talks

### Joint Mathematics Meeting '25. Seattle, WA Jan 7--11.
<small>The Joint Mathematics Meetings (JMM) is a mathematics conference hosted annually in early January by the American Mathematical Society (AMS). Frequently, several other national mathematics organizations also participate. The meeting is the largest gathering of mathematicians in the United States, and the largest annual meeting of mathematicians in the world. Several thousand talks, panels, minicourses, and poster sessions are held each year. This year I attended the following talks. </small>

## Travel

> "Not all those who wander are lost." --- J.R.R. Tolkien, The Fellowship of the Ring

- **Seattle, WA --- Jan 7--11**. Joint Mathematics Meeting (JMM25). Got to hang out with SE; food was beyond amazing --- Halal Smash'd Burgers, Moroccan lamb roll, curry beef hom bao, dinner at *Zaika* with SE and family.
- **Pasadena, CA --- Jan 24--26**. Caltech Math Meet (CMM). Road trip with dad. Had *Din Tai Fung* for both dinners. Highlight: listening to music on the drive to and from. It was snowing near LA on the way back!!
- **Boston, MA --- Feb 14--16**. Harvard-MIT Math Tournament (HMMT Feb). Got to hang out with WZ; dinner from *Himalayan Kitchen* on Fri; "*Ghana Bitter*" from Royce chocolates on Sat. Several inches of snow coated the streets from a storm Saturday night into Sunday morning.
- **San Francisco, CA --- Feb 22**. *Strings for Peace*. Ustad Amjad Ali Khan & Sharon Isbin. Dinner at *Mochica Peruvian* followed by hangout at the corner bookstore. Concert at Herbst Theater from 730PM--10PM. It was fantastic!
