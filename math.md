> "Perhaps I could best describe my experience of doing mathematics in terms of entering a dark mansion. You go into the first room and it's dark, completely dark. You stumble around, bumping into the furniture. Gradually, you learn where each piece of furniture is. And finally, after six months or so, you find the light switch and turn it on. Suddenly, it's all illuminated and you can see exactly where you were. Then you enter the next dark room..." --- Andrew John Wiles

I’m a student with a deep interest in mathematics and physics, drawn to both the elegance of problem-solving and the depth of long-term exploration.

<br>
My early years were spent immersed in math contests&mdash;I began the AMC series in second grade, qualified for the AIME in fourth grade, and by age 12 had achieved a 
perfect score on the AMC 8 and qualified for the USAMO. That same year, I placed 4th nationally on Math Kangaroo Level 12, a competition intended for high school seniors.

<br>
Around this time I became curious about what mathematics looked like beyond competitions. As a 12 year old freshman, I was accepted into the MIT PRIMES-USA program, where 
I’ve spent three years researching topics in commutative algebra, representation theory, and combinatorics. I’ve co-authored four papers, including one recognized with a 
USA Bronze Medal in Mathematics at the S.-T. Yau High School Science Awards. As a World Science Scholar (WSS ’24), I’ve had the chance to explore interdisciplinary science 
under the guidance of world-renowned researchers.

<br>
As I turned 14, my passion for contests was rekindled through the Putnam Exam, a competition designed for undergraduates, which I took as a high school junior and ranked 58
(among ~4000) and earned an Honorable Mention. Getting back on the AMC track, I recently won a USAMO Gold Award and attended the MAA’s Math Olympiad Program (MOP 2025)&mdash;
while continuing my research and advanced coursework through San José State University, Euler Circle, and AoPS.

<br>
I’m happiest where speed and depth meet&mdash;where ideas unfold in both bursts and slow revelations.
