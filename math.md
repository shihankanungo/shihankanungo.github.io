&mdash; Antoine de Saint-Exupéry, The Little Prince

<br>
I’m a student with a deep interest in mathematics and physics, drawn to both the elegance of problem-solving and the depth of long-term exploration.

<br>
My early years were spent immersed in math contests&mdash;I began the AMC series in second grade, qualified for the AIME in fourth grade, and by age 12 had achieved a 
perfect score on the AMC 8 and qualified for the USAMO. That same year, I placed 4th nationally on Math Kangaroo Level 12, a competition intended for high school seniors.

<br>
Around this time I became curious about what mathematics looked like beyond competitions. As a 12 year old freshman, I was accepted into the MIT PRIMES-USA program, where 
I’ve spent three years researching topics in commutative algebra, representation theory, and combinatorics. I’ve co-authored four papers, including one recognized with a 
USA Bronze Medal in Mathematics at the S.-T. Yau High School Science Awards. As a World Science Scholar (WSS ’24), I’ve had the chance to explore interdisciplinary science 
under the guidance of world-renowned researchers.

<br>
As I turned 14, my passion for contests was rekindled through the Putnam Exam, a competition designed for undergraduates, which I took as a high school junior, placing 58th nationally among thousands of undergraduates&mdash;thereby earning an Honorable Mention. Getting back on the AMC track, I have recently won a USAMO Gold Award and attended the MAA’s Math Olympiad Program (MOP 2025)&mdash;while continuing my research and advanced coursework through San José State University, Euler Circle, and AoPS.

<br>
I am a 2023 Spirit of Ramanujan Fellow and a recipient of the 2025 Global Child Prodigy Award. I’m happiest where speed and depth meet&mdash;where ideas unfold in both bursts and slow revelations.
