When you're not being productive in a meaningful way, take a page from Cal Newport’s concept of “deep work.” Newport emphasizes the importance of sustained, undistracted focus on cognitively demanding tasks, helping ensure depth and mastery rather than superficial exploration. As Newport explains, 
> “In order for a session to count as deep work there must be zero distractions. Even a quick glance at your phone or email inbox can significantly reduce your performance due to the cost of context switching.”

When I’m learning about a new subject, for example, I set a timer, silence my devices and notifications, and aim to get into a state of flow. I try to immerse myself in the topic and let distractions and concerns fade into the background. Best case scenario? I lose track of time until the alarm pulls me back. After several focused learning sprints, however, I start to notice diminishing returns—my thoughts feel slower, and my brain begins to feel saturated. That’s when it’s time to switch gears and tackle a different task.
