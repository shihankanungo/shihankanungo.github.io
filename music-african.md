African music is as vast and varied as the continent itself. With more than 50 countries and thousands of ethnic groups, Africa has given rise to an astonishing range of musical styles. Rooted in traditions that span centuries, yet continually evolving in conversation with global sounds, African music is both local and universal. From spiritual rituals to political protest, from dance floors to world stages, it is the pulse of community life and a driving force of global popular culture.
