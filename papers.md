  <summary style="list-style-type: none;"><i>The Fundamental Group</i>. Algebraic Topology [ <a href="fundgrp.pdf" target="_blank" style="text-decoration: none">PDF</a> ] </summary>
  <small>We introduce the fundamental group as the first algebraic invariant of a topological space and the primary tool for detecting topological "holes." By lifting loops along the covering map and interpreting homotopy in terms of winding number, we compute the fundamental group of the circle to be the integers <b>Z</b>.<br></small><br>

  <small>This paper serves as a bridge between abstract ring theory and the geometric concepts of Algebraic Geometry. We explore how the Krull dimension, defined by chains of prime ideals, acts as the algebraic analogue of geometric dimension (e.g., points, curves, surfaces). We present localization as the algebraic tool that allows us to "zoom in" on a specific prime ideal to study the ring's isolated, local structure.<br></small><br>

  <small>We describe the natural interpretation of the game in terms of simplicial complexes, and the binary star reduction technique that shows that <i>Subset 
  Takeaway</i> is a second player win for <i>n</i> < 7. We also look at Subset Takeway played on a graph, and compute the Grundy values for complete <i>n</i>-partite

  <small>We examine space-filling curves, which are surjective continuous maps from [0, 1] to some higher-dimensional space, usually the unit square [0, 1]<sup>2</sup>. In 
  particular, we define Peano’s curve and Lebesgue’s curve, and state some of their properties. We also discuss the Hahn-Mazurkiewicz theorem, which characterizes those 
  subsets of <b>R</b><sup>n</sup> that are the image of a space-filling curve. Finally, we discuss real-world applications of Hilbert curves, in particular Google’s 
  <b>S2</b> Cells.<br></small><br>

  <small>We explore the Hahn–Banach Theorem’s foundational role in functional analysis and its critical applications in mathematical finance. Through both conceptual exposition and a worked example, we demonstrate how the theorem enables the extension of pricing functionals and underpins the existence of risk-neutral measures in arbitrage-free markets.<br></small><br>

  <summary style="list-style-type: none;"><i>Sobolev Spaces and Applications to PDEs</i>. Theory of PDEs [ <a href="sobolev.pdf" target="_blank" style="text-decoration: none">PDF</a> ] </summary>
  <small>We provide an introduction to Sobolev spaces, a foundational concept in modern analysis and the theory of partial differential equations (PDEs). These spaces are useful for studying, among other things, the well-posedness of partial differential equations and their approximation using finite elements. We begin with a historical overview, tracing the development of weak derivatives and the shift from classical to variational formulations of PDEs. After establishing the basic definitions and presenting key examples, we survey central theorems such as the Sobolev Embedding Theorem and Rellich's Theorem, emphasizing their significance in ensuring existence, uniqueness, and regularity of solutions. Finally, we discuss a classic application to PDEs, the Elliptic Regularity Theorem. We aim to provide a self-contained and accessible introduction for students with a background in real analysis and the theory of PDEs.<br></small><br>

  <summary style="list-style-type: none;"><i>The Stochastic Gradient Descent Method</i>. Stochastic Methods [ <a href="sgd.pdf" target="_blank" style="text-decoration: none">PDF</a> ] </summary>
  <small>Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) is a cornerstone algorithm in modern optimization, especially prevalent in large-scale machine learning. This paper introduces the theoretical foundation of SGD, contrasts it with deterministic gradient descent, and explores its convergence properties, practical implementation considerations, and typical applications in applied mathematics and data science. We also give some basic numerical simulations which showcase the strengths of different variants of SGD.<br></small><br>

  <summary style="list-style-type: none;"><i>On the S-matrix Conjecture for even n</i>. Nonnegative Matrices [ <a href="smatrix.pdf" target="_blank" style="text-decoration: none">PDF</a> ] </summary>
  <small>Motivated with a problem in spectroscopy, Sloane and Harwit conjectured in 1976 what is the minimal Frobenius norm of the inverse of a matrix having all entries from the interval [0,1]. This is known as the <i>S</i>-matrix conjecture. In 1987, Cheng proved their conjecture in the case of odd dimensions, while for even dimensions he obtained a slightly weaker lower bound for the norm. In this report we discuss Frankel and Urschel's proof of the <i>S</i>-matrix conjecture for all even <i>n</i> larger than a small constant.<br></small><br>

  <small>A general introduction to the theory of chromatic polynomials. We derive their salient properties, and describe some practicaI methods for computing them. We 
  briefly discuss the connection between the theory of chromatic polynomials and map coloring problems.<br></small><br>

  <summary style="list-style-type: none;"><i>Lagrangian and Hamiltonian Mechanics</i>. Dynamical Systems [ <a href="lhd.pdf" target="_blank" style="text-decoration: none">PDF</a> ] </summary>
  <small>we discuss the basics of Lagrangian and Hamiltonian dynamics. We derive the Euler-Lagrange equations fro D’Alembert’s principle, show that they are equivalent to 
  Hamilton’s principle of least actions, and finally use them to derive Hamilton’s equations. We also provide some examples to illustrate the use of Lagrangian and 
  Hamiltonian dynamics.<br></small><br>

  <summary style="list-style-type: none;"><i>Brun's Theorem</i>. Number Theory [ <a href="brun.pdf" target="_blank" style="text-decoration: none">PDF</a> ] </summary>
  <small>The mathematician Viggo Brun was born in Sweden in 1885. He is known for his outstanding contributions to the field of number theory. In his early career, Brun 
  focused on analytic number theory and prime number theory. One of his most famous achievements was Brun’s theorem in 1915, which gave an upper bound on the distance 
  between prime numbers.<br></small><br>

  <small>We give a summary of the upper bounds that have been obtained for the maximal prime gap, <i>G(x)</i>, over the last century, particularly Rankin’s lower bound, 
  and the improvement to it discovered independently by Ford-Green-Konyagin-Tao and Maynard in 2014. We go over a sketch of Rankin’s, Ford-Green-Konyagin-Tao’s, and 
  Maynard’s proofs of their bounds, omitting technical details but still presenting the main ideas.<br></small><br>

  <small>The field of dynamical billiards studies the motion of a ball bouncing within a billiard table, which is bounded by a smooth, closed curve. The ball's movement 
  adheres to two key properties: it always travels in a straight line, and the angle of incidence equals the angle of reflection at the boundary. The latter property is an 
  empirical observation from physics. In this paper, we analyze the dynamics of various billiard tables in <b>R</b><sup>2</sup>, employing Euclidean geometric methods to 
  investigate and classify their ergodic behavior. Specifically, we examine the ergodicity of billiards within circular and annular (circular ring) boundaries and present 
  some results on elliptic billiards. Additionally, we explore examples of chaotic billiards, where chaos is characterized by the lack of correlation between the starting 
  point and subsequent positions after many bounces. In such cases, even a slight variation in the initial conditions can lead to significantly divergent trajectories. 
  Finally, we conclude with a discussion of a physical application of billiards.<br></small><br>

  <summary style="list-style-type: none;"><i>Arithmetic Dynamics</i>. Number Theory [ <a href="http://simonrs.com/eulercircle/nt2023/shihan-arithdyn.pdf" target="_blank" style="text-decoration: none">PDF</a> ] </summary>
  <small>We explore the field of arithmetic dynamics, which lies at the intersection of discrete dynamical systems and number theory. Discrete dynamical systems focus on 
  the iterative behavior of functions, while number theory examines the properties of integers. Combining these two areas gives rise to arithmetic dynamics, where we 
  investigate the number-theoretic properties of orbits of integers and rational numbers under the iteration of polynomials and rational functions. The core idea of 
  arithmetic dynamics is to consider a function mapping a set to itself and analyze its behavior under repeated iteration. In this paper, we begin by defining the set of 
  <i>p</i>-adic numbers and presenting key results related to them. We then examine an application of arithmetic dynamics, establishing a connection to dynamical systems 
  in the <i>p</i>-adic numbers.<br></small><br>

  <small>We introduce the theory of minimal surfaces. In the chapter on Geodesics, we considered the problem of finding the shortest distance between two points. We 
  investigate the higher dimensional analogue of this, where we find ways to construct a surface of "minimal" area with a given boundary. Such surfaces can be represented 
  by soap films, where the surface tension of the film ensures that it attains a shape with the minimal surface area. Minimal surfaces can be found in anything from the 
  event horizons of black holes, to biomolecules for drug delivery, to the designs of roofs.<br></small><br>

  <small>We talk about one of the most well-known shuffling methods, called the <i>riffle shuffle</i> or <i>dovetail shuffle</i>. We are interested in the number of 
  shuffles that will make the deck of <i>n</i> cards well-mixed, or <i>close</i> to uniformly random.<br></small><br>

  <small>We first discuss the question of which integers <i>n</i> have exactly one group of order <i>n</i>, namely the cyclic group <b>Z</b>/<i>n</i><b>Z</b>. We will see 
  that these are the integers that are relatively prime to the Euler totient function &phi;(<i>n</i>). Then we discuss how many groups there are of order <i>p</i>  
  <sup>3</sup> for each prime <i>p</i>. We end with a couple of interesting results and conjectures pertaining to groups of squarefree order.<br></small><br>
