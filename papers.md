## Expository 

- David Gale's Subset Takeaway Game. *Combinatorial Game Theory* \[ [pdf](http://simonrs.com/eulercircle/cgt2024/shihan-subset.pdf) \] <br>
  <small>We describe the natural interpretation of the game in terms of simplicial complexes, and the binary star reduction technique that shows that Subset Takeaway is a second player win for *n* < 7. We also look at Subset Takeway played on a graph, and compute the Grundy values for complete *n*-partite graphs and all bipartite graphs.</small> <br>
  
- Space-Filling Curves. *Real Analysis* \[ [pdf](space-filling-curves.pdf) \] <br>
  <small>We examine space-filling curves, which are surjective continuous maps from \[0, 1\] to some higher-dimensional space, usually the unit square \[0, 1\]<sup>2</sup>. In particular, we define Peano’s curve and Lebesgue’s curve, and state some of their properties. We also discuss the Hahn-Mazurkiewicz theorem, which characterizes those subsets of **R**<sup>*n*</sup> that are the image of a space-filling curve. Finally, we discuss real-world applications of Hilbert curves, in particular Google’s S2 Cells.</small> <br>
  
- Chromatic Polynomials. *Graph Theory* \[ [pdf](chromatic-polynomials.pdf) \] <br>
  <small>A general introduction to the theory of chromatic polynomials. We derive their salient properties, and describe some practicaI methods for computing them. We briefly discuss the connection between the theory of chromatic polynomials and map coloring problems.</small> <br>
  
- Large Gaps Between Primes. *Analytic Number Theory* \[ [pdf](http://simonrs.com/eulercircle/analyticnt2024/shihan-largegaps.pdf) \] <br>
  <small>We give a summary of the upper bounds that have been obtained for the maximal prime gap, *G(x)*, over the last century, particularly Rankin’s lower bound, and the improvement to it discovered independently by Ford-Green-Konyagin-Tao and Maynard in 2014. We go over a sketch of Rankin’s, Ford-Green-Konyagin-Tao’s, and Maynard’s proofs of their bounds, omitting technical details but still presenting the main ideas.</small> <br>
   
- Dynamical Billiards. *Ergodic Theory* \[ [pdf](http://simonrs.com/eulercircle/ergodic2024/shihan-billiards.pdf) \] <br>
  <small>The field of dynamical billiards studies the motion of a ball bouncing within a billiard table, which is bounded by a smooth, closed curve. The ball's movement adheres to two key properties: it always travels in a straight line, and the angle of incidence equals the angle of reflection at the boundary. The latter property is an empirical observation from physics. In this paper, we analyze the dynamics of various billiard tables in R<sup>2</sup>, employing Euclidean geometric methods to investigate and classify their ergodic behavior. Specifically, we examine the ergodicity of billiards within circular and annular (circular ring) boundaries and present some results on elliptic billiards. Additionally, we explore examples of chaotic billiards, where chaos is characterized by the lack of correlation between the starting point and subsequent positions after many bounces. In such cases, even a slight variation in the initial conditions can lead to significantly divergent trajectories. Finally, we conclude with a discussion of a physical application of billiards.</small> <br>
  
- Arithmetic Dynamics. *Number Theory* \[ [pdf](http://simonrs.com/eulercircle/nt2023/shihan-arithdyn.pdf) \] <br>
  <small>We explore the field of arithmetic dynamics, which lies at the intersection of discrete dynamical systems and number theory. Discrete dynamical systems focus on the iterative behavior of functions, while number theory examines the properties of integers. Combining these two areas gives rise to arithmetic dynamics, where we investigate the number-theoretic properties of orbits of integers and rational numbers under the iteration of polynomials and rational functions. The core idea of arithmetic dynamics is to consider a function mapping a set to itself and analyze its behavior under repeated iteration. In this paper, we begin by defining the set of *p*-adic numbers and presenting key results related to them. We then examine an application of arithmetic dynamics, establishing a connection to dynamical systems in the *p*-adic numbers.</small> <br>
  
- Minimal surfaces. *Differential Geometry* \[ [pdf](http://simonrs.com/eulercircle/diffgeo/shihan-minimal.pdf) \] <br>
  <small>We introduce the theory of minimal surfaces. In the chapter on Geodesics, we considered the problem of finding the shortest distance between two points. We investigate the higher dimensional analogue of this, where we find ways to construct a surface of "minimal" area with a given boundary. Such surfaces can be represented by soap films, where the surface tension of the film ensures that it attains a shape with the minimal surface area. Minimal surfaces can be found in anything from the
event horizons of black holes, to biomolecules for drug delivery, to the designs of roofs.</small> <br>
  
- Mixing-time estimates for riffle shuffle. *Markov Chains* \[ [pdf](http://simonrs.com/eulercircle/markovchains/shihan-riffle.pdf) \] <br>
  <small>We talk about one of the most well-known shuffling methods, called the "riffle shuffle" or "dovetail shuffle". We are interested in the number of shuffles
that will make the deck of *n* cards well-mixed, or "close" to uniformly random.</small> <br>
  
- Classifying groups of certain orders. *Abstract Algebra* \[ [pdf](http://simonrs.com/eulercircle/algebra2020/shihan-orders.pdf) \] <br>
  <small>We first discuss the question of which integers *n* have exactly one group of order *n*, namely the cyclic group **Z**/*n***Z**. We will see that these
are the integers that are relatively prime to the Euler totient function phi(*n*). Then we discuss how many groups there are of order *p*<sup>3</sup> for each prime *p*. We
end with a couple of interesting results and conjectures pertaining to groups of squarefree order.</small> <br>
