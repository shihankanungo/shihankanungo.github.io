This year, MAA‚Äôs Mathematical Olympiad Summer Program (MOP '25) was held at IMSA &mdash; *The Illinois Mathematics and Science Academy*, from June 11--July 2, 2025.


## Day 0 &mdash; Sunday, June 8-11, 2025

### Chicago, Isaac Chang, Arun Kannan.

Reached Chicago a few days early and stayed at *The Chicago Marriott Southwest at Burr Ridge* ‚Äì which is a fantastic hotel! Our room overlooked a beautiful view with a pond within a lush green rolling meadow. 

<p align="center"><img src="/images/burr-ridge.png" width="500" /></p>

Dinner on Sunday was pizza at _Stix and Stones_ which was incredible. <br> On Monday I met with Isaac Chang at the University of Chicago, where he is doing a triple major &mdash; Math, Physics, and CS!  

<p align="center"><img src="/images/isaac.jpg" width="400" /></p>

Isaac showed us around the campus and told us many interesting anecdotes. Mama took us to lunch at West 57th. In the evening, we had a fabulous dinner at _Kama Bistro_ --- black pepper lamb and achari chicken. I met with Arun on Tuesday at _Cupitol Coffee & Eatery_. We then had lunch at _Momo Factory_ followed by dinner at  _Stix and Stones_ (a repeat &mdash; yes it was that good!!). On Wednesday morning, mama and baba dropped me off at Terminal 2 of the Chicago O'Hare International Airport for the 1145AM shuttle to IMSA.

## Day 1 &mdash; Wednesday, June 11, 2025

### Rooms, Evan Fan, Yoll Feng

A bunch of MOPpers started throwing olympiad problems at each other when we were roaming through the IMSA halls. It was quite fun!

The general community at MOP is quite friendly and inclusive. People play a lot of cards, and we also played pickleball.

Our rooms are pretty good; exactly like the pictures Hannah shared. We overlook a really nice view from the window. I‚Äôm sharing the room with Evan Fan, another junior. I like him quite a bit, and he reminds me of Allen Li from physics camp.

<p align="center"><img src="/images/mop1.png" width="400" /> <br> <span style="color: gray"> Evan Fan &mdash; my roommate! </span> </p> 

Yoll is exactly like Jerry Guo, but nicer I think; he is also quite funny! I will be going for a run in the morning with Liam. 

I‚Äôm excited for MOP. I think that I will have a great time, and make a lot of friends.

## Day 2 &mdash; Thursday, June 12, 2025

### First day of classes, run group, ELMO teams, Aryan Raj

We had our first MOP classes today: on prime powers and hidden graphs in combo problems. I enjoyed both of them, and what I really appreciated were the little insights that the instructors gave us while walking us through the solutions. I also presented my 17-page solution in MOP homework review.

MOP loves to play sports! I went for a run with Liam, Tiger, and Aryan in the morning. I think that this is going to be the running group. All four of us are serious. I also played basketball for an hour, and then played Frisbee for an hour. I played for 3 hours today ... would make Baba proud!

ELMO teams were decided; Jonathan told me I was in the first draft. 

<p align="center"><img src="/images/mop2b.png" width="400"/> <br> <span style="color: gray"> with Jonathan Du </span> </p>

There are 7 teams in ELMO and they compete for the best score. Its a team captain format &mdash; each captain is one of the returners. I found out that I'm on team **Xooks** (captains: Calvin Wang and Oron Wang) and my team id is XOO7 ... so I guess that makes me James Bond!

I met Aryan Raj on the bus to IMSA. I like talking to him a lot; I think it is because we are on the same wavelength about many things.

I had a lot of fun at MOP today. Tomorrow is our first test. Time to lock in!

<br><br>

<br>

## Day 3 &mdash; Friday, June 13, 2025

### MOP Test 1, cubic curves, 2-sigma, Liam Reddy.

The MOP classes today were both lecture-based: we had an inequalities class, which was just analysis and Lagrange multipliers, and a class on cubic curves which was very interesting, but I have no clue how to apply it. We also had our first MOP test, which I did reasonably well on (expecting 750). I spent a lot of time on P2 with a completely wrong idea but I ultimately figured it out. However I didn't have time to fully finish the writeup &mdash; I got to a point where the finish is quite easy. Also, my solution has a small (patchable) error.

We had a 2-Sigma dinner, where they gave a presentation and also got us free boba. The boba was good, but Arun‚Äôs explanation of what quants do was much better than the presentation.

Today I found out that Liam skipped two grades &mdash; just like me! He is a very nice person, and he cares about other people. He will always help you out if you ask him.

<p align="center"><img src="/images/mop3.png" width="400"/> <br> <span style="color: gray"> with Liam Reddy and Aryan Raj </span> </p>

ELMO is tomorrow. I‚Äôm feeling good about it &mdash; coming in strong after the MOP test. I will skip my run tomorrow&mdash;after all, it‚Äôs Saturday. I will also be doing my laundry.

<br><br>

<br>

## Day 4 &mdash; Saturday, June 14, 2025

### ELMO Day 1, Oron Wang, quantumelectrodynamics.

Today was ELMO day 1. Dotted decided to troll us by making the ELMO as the ‚ÄúError-Littered Math Olympiad‚Äù, where all the problems were covered with random error messages and one of them was in Japanese. The ELSMO (which is supposed to be the troll version) was the ‚ÄúElmo Loves Swapping Math Olympiads‚Äù, and was the actual test. I got P1 pretty quickly: it was an arrow problem. P2 was easy for me as well, mostly because I was able to reduce it to a problem from the Blue MOP combinatorics class (which I had solved). I then proceeded to spend 3 hours on P3, continually fakesolving and patching my solution until I finally got it. But right after the test, I realized that I got the wrong answer, and then someone pointed out that I misread the problem. It turns out that this happened to a bunch of people, and I was feeling very grumpy about that. But, in the evening, as Dotted was going through our team‚Äôs P3 submissions, he said that I should get a 4 or a 5 (which would be one of the top scores)! It turns out that my solution was on the right track, and most of it actually matched the official (correct) solution! So I‚Äôm feeling good now! Yay!

Oron is a very interesting character. Whenever he is working on a problem he starts randomly saying the words "Yay", "Spam", and "Buh". Someone said that MOP has a tradition of degen a few days ago. I think this is it.

<p align="center"><img src="/images/mop4.png" width="400" /> <br> <span style="color: gray"> Oron Wang </span> </p> 

Today Grant Blitz and I were able to figure out who _quantumelectrodynamics_ (QED) was. A lot of people have been trying to find out, and yesterday Liam and Oron concluded that it was an alt account. At breakfast, Grant saw that QED was online, so I asked him to text QED "are u at breakfast?" to which QED replied "yes", so we immediately looked around to see who was on their phones. But then QED went offline, so we looked to see who had just put away their phone. There was one person who did: it was Dotted. We then sent him a few more texts, and the online/offline and typing patterns exactly matched! Dotted still won‚Äôt admit that he‚Äôs QED though.

Tomorrow is an off day: no classes or tests. It will be nice to relax and just hang out.

## Day 5 &mdash; Sunday, June 15, 2025

### First free day, ELMO coordination, Jonathan Du, excursion.

Today was an off day: there were no classes (except for a seminar on elliptic integrals). But ELMO coordination was in full swing. Calvin spent 5 hours arguing with Liam about our team‚Äôs problem 1 submissions, and a good bit of that was on mine. They were debating whether to give a 4 or a 5. I felt that I should have got a 5, but due to the way that other peoples solutions were graded, we had to settle on a 4. But this caused me to decide to join in participating in writing the RELMO, and I‚Äôve started working on a problem which imitates ELMO P2 and my p1 coordination, except in the problem I win.

I hang out with Jonathan quite a bit; we often sit together during MOP classes. He has an extremely good sense of humor and often makes very funny jokes. 

Today Jiahe organized a walk where a bunch of people went on an ‚Äúexcursion‚Äù to a place with a bunch of restaurants. I planned on going, but I was talking with Calvin about ELMO coordination when they left.

I have made too many silly mistakes on the tests: 3 out of 5 problems I attempted. I think I need to sleep earlier so that I don‚Äôt get woken up by random noises, and I also need to be calmer during the tests.

## Day 6 &mdash; Monday, June 16, 2025

### Spiral similarity, Alexander Wang, RELMO committee, Connor Leong.

Today we had a class by Vivian Loh on spiral similarity! (Baba‚Äôs favorite subject). Then we had two consecutive classes on polynomials. The first one had a nerfed version of ELMO P3 on the first problem, and the second had Decartes‚Äô Rule of Signs üíÄ. I also talked to Dotted about RELMO, and it turns out that we both ripped a problem from our PRIMES projects, and they are both about extremal functions.

Connor Leong is an excellent Frisbee player. After the ELMO, he said that my P3 submission was ‚Äúbrilliant‚Äù multiple times. Also, when we play Frisbee, if we are on opposite teams, he always guards me and if we are on the same team, he always dabs me up when we score a point. I think that he likes me a lot, and I like him too. He is part of the "cards group‚Äù, which also includes Vihaan, Rohan, David (who is probably the best at Frisbee), Ryan, and Kailua. I‚Äôve started joining them for cards in the past few days.

<p align="center"><img src="/images/mop6a.png" width="500"/> <br> <span style="color: gray"> Connor Leong </span> </p>

Our second Assembly was today. We voted on the MOP t-shirt. There were 3 designs: one about a cross-section of a cube (which had nothing to do with the USAMO), one with the letters M,O,S,P in a grid, and one which had the words MOSP and YAY which looked like they were written with a computer mouse, and a graph symbolizing USAMO P2. I wanted the last one to win, but alas common sense prevailed and the first one won. 

Yesterday, I was able to get a sound sleep by wrapping a shirt around my eyes as an eye mask, and playing Max Richter ‚ÄúSleep‚Äù on my earbuds. I think that I will do that for the rest of camp. Baba has also ordered an eye mask for me, which I will probably get tomorrow.

## Day 7 &mdash; Tuesday, June 17, 2025

### MOP Test 2, Yoll Feng, story-time.

MOP Test 2 was today. Problem 1 was an anti-problem!!!! I spent almost 3 hours on it, and I seriously thought that I was going to get swept. But I got it eventually. Unfortunately, I didn‚Äôt have time to solve P2, which was hard. I had all the right ideas though, and if I had more time I think I would have got it. It turns out that I was kind of right to be scared &mdash; Jonathan and Oron both got swept, and I am predicting 720. 

We had classes on determinants and entropy today; they were both interesting, although the problems felt a bit like AIME problems &mdash; i.e., computational.

I think Yoll Feng looks up to me; he has often expressed concern about the TSTST and asked me for advice. And today he asked me for some of my ‚Äúorzness‚Äù before the test. I told him that he‚Äôd do fine.

Today was storytime; I had completely forgotten about it. I hadn‚Äôt checked my computer the whole day since I didn‚Äôt take it in my bag, so I didn‚Äôt see Baba‚Äôs message. I went after I called Baba and I saw the message, but it was too late. Hopefully, I will catch another one before MOP ends.

In this MOP test, I didn‚Äôt make any mistakes. However, I think that I might have spent a bit too much time on P1 going down a rabbit hole. I think that I should remember to stop and look for alternate approaches; I sometimes trust my intuition too much.

## Day 8 &mdash; Wednesday, June 18, 2025

### RELMO, Jane Street, Grant Blitz, "Combination Pizza Hut and Taco Bell".

I worked on my RELMO problems today. It‚Äôs not easy to write problems; even if you‚Äôre trying to make them as bad as possible. I have a problem taken from my Geneson project; unfortunately I don‚Äôt know how to solve it. I was able to finish the second one; about the S-matrix conjecture.

I like talking to Grant Blitz. He is refreshingly ‚Äúnot-asian‚Äù and his voice is very nice to listen to. He is a geo-main, and he goes to Exeter, just like Evan Fan. I think he is a very unselfish person; and he cares about others.

Today, I started singing ‚ÄúCombination Pizza Hut and Taco Bell‚Äù in class, and now it‚Äôs become kind of a meme. My favorite target was Oron, but he went home and listened to the song; and now he‚Äôs my partner in crime.

We had Jane Street today &mdash; the estimathon was unbelievably hard! My team came in second-to-last!!

<p align="center"><img src="/images/mop8.png" width="500"/> <br> <span style="color: gray"> Estimathon! L to R: Daniel, Kevin, Tarun, Aryan, (also Michael, Oron). </span> </p>

MOP test 3 is tomorrow; I want to make this my ‚Äúcomeback‚Äù. I would like to solve a hard problem; a problem that I‚Äôm proud of doing.

<br><br>

<br>

## Day 9 &mdash; Thursday, June 19, 2025

### MOP Test 3, "Combination Pizza Hut and Taco Bell", ANT, Jiahe Liu, story-time.

MOP Test 3 was today; I was able to solve P1 quite easily using _Combination Pizza Hut and Taco Bell_; essentially, we had a sequence with two properties and I called the first one _Pizza Hut_ and the second one _Taco Bell_. P2 was a hard geo problem (which only Tiger solved synthetically; everyone else complex bashed or used the isoptic cubic) &mdash; I just submitted the lyrics to _Combination Pizza Hut and Taco Bell_; I‚Äôm hoping to get a style score satisfying x(1-x)=0. P3 was a combo problem which I fakesolved (argh!!). I got the first idea, which was to make it a graph, but I thought there was only one possibility for the graph. I had even checked and rewritten my solution, but I didn‚Äôt catch the mistake. I believe I would have solved the problem if I had caught the mistake.

We had a class on analytic number theory, and the problem set was exactly like in Euler Circle: the problems were super hard and there was even an open problem! One of the problems was to show that every Diophantine equation is equivalent to a quartic. 

Jiahe is very good at both olympiad math and theory; like me. In all of the non-geo theory classes, we are usually the ones answering all the questions. For example, in the entropy class, the instructor at one point asked a question and said ‚Äúcould somebody who is not one of the two people who‚Äôve been answering everything please tell us how to do this?‚Äù

<p align="center"><img src="/images/mop9.png" width="400"/> <br> <span style="color: gray"> Jiahe Liu </span> </p>

I attended storytime today. The discussions were quite stimulating. We talked about old- vs. new MOP; how COVID affected math olympiads; Zuming Feng stories; and more. I‚Äôm glad that I attended, and I‚Äôll definitely go again.

Tomorrow, I will ask Evan Chen to make me a geo bashing handout. I‚Äôve realized that I might become a geo antimain if I‚Äôm not careful. That‚Äôs something I do not want to be.

<br><br>

## Day 10 &mdash; Friday, June 20, 2025

### Picture Day!! Problem Solving Geometry, and Probabilistic method; Alexander Wang

Today was picture day!! 

<p align="center"><img src="/images/mop10.jpg" width="700"/> <br> <span style="color: gray"> MOP 2025 on the bleachers!!. </span> </p>

I also have a surprise for baba ‚Äî I said I won‚Äôt tell him what till the talent show. It's going to be a surprise. It will involve me and Oron playing improv piano.

The classes today were super good! Our first class was ‚ÄúProblem Solving Geometry‚Äù, taught by Brian Lawrence. There were no configs, big theorems or bashing; just pure geo. I really liked how he told us to pay attention to how we got unstuck on a problem, and made a list of questions to ask ourselves. I think that if I use these ideas, I can become very good at synthetic geo.  We next had a probabilistic method class taught by Milan, and Jiahe and I solved an RMM 3 in two different ways! We even generalized the problem. Finally, Jordan gave us a True/False class, where each question becomes easy once you‚Äôre convinced what the answer is. I spent a lot of time on a problem involving Liam and Tiger playing a game; but I wasn‚Äôt able to get it. I‚Äôll keep thinking about it because Jordan said it was a nice problem.

Alexander Wang is not very mature, but he‚Äôs nice to talk to once you get to know him. He‚Äôs a loud person, and he tends to be at the center of the conversation (but not in a bad way!). He‚Äôs also quite good at piano; we heard him practicing when Tiger, Oron, and I were in the music rooms. Tiger and Oron are also very good; I think that Tiger is the best. 

<p align="center"><img src="/images/mop10a.jpg" width="400"/> <br> <span style="color: gray"> Alexander Wang aka <i>dottedcaculator</i> </span> </p>

I‚Äôve made far too many mistakes on the tests. Tomorrow is ELMO, and the TSTSTs are coming up. No more fooling around. I need to be 100% focused on the tests and make sure that I perform to the peak of my ability.

<br><br>

<br>

## Day 11 &mdash; Saturday, June 21, 2025

### ELMO Day 2, story-time, Rohan Garg

Today was ELMO day 2. P4 was a geo problem; we had to prove that a circle and a line were tangent. Unfortunately, my diagram had an inaccuracy, so I spent the first hour not realizing that the tangency point was a point already in the diagram. Then I knew it would be an angle chase; which proved to be a bit tricky. I got it relatively easily though. P5 was a number theory problem, which I fakesolved at first. But since I knew that I was going to make a mistake, I carefully checked my solution and caught the error. I then proceeded to fix it and get a correct solution. P6 was a combo problem which looked familiar, but I wasn‚Äôt able to make much nontrivial progress. It turns out that no one solved it; in fact no one (including the IMO team) but the proposer of the problem was able to do so. I was a bit bummed, because this meant that I would lose to Royce Yao by 2 points in the overall ELMO. But I guess this is my fault: I missed 3 completely gettable points on P1. 

Today was a relaxed day; nothing much besides the ELMO happened. We had pizza for dinner after the ELMO, and we also had storytime. There were not many people at storytime, but it was still fun. 

<p align="center"><img src="/images/mop11b.jpg" width="300"/> <br> <span style="color: gray"> Just got out of storytime ... </span> </p>

Now even the staff know about Combination Pizza Hut and Taco Bell! I think it was because I put it on all of my MOP Test 3 solutions. Some people also made a trio of polls on the MOP server: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm at the Pizza Hut‚Äù, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm at the Taco Bell‚Äù, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm at the combination pizza hut and taco bell‚Äù. As of Saturday evening, it has 15 likes and only 5 thumbs downs. 

<p align="center"><img src="/images/mop11.png" width="400"/> <br> <span style="color: gray"> Polls in the MOP discord server </span> </p>

Rohan Garg is a pretty chill guy. He‚Äôs not a super excitable person like many other MOPpers, but he does like to talk, especially while playing cards. He is a "geo super-antimain", and say‚Äôs that he‚Äôs an NT main, but he solved the geo and didn‚Äôt solve the NT on this test‚Ä¶

<p align="center"><img src="/images/mop11a.png" width="300"/> <br> <span style="color: gray"> Rohan Garg </span> </p>

ELMO Day 2 went well, but I still made a mistake (even though I caught it). I need to figure out how to stay calm, and do everything correctly the first time.

## Day 12 &mdash; Sunday, June 22, 2025

### 2nd Free Day! Lightning talks, seminar.

Today was Sunday &mdash; a free day! Yay! There were no classes and no tests. The only math-related thing I did was work on the RELMO with Dotted. We have 12 problems, which is perfect: we can do a RELMO with 6 and a RELSMO with the other 6. Tony Lu gave us a really nice problem based on his PRIMES research with Prof. Gotti. Most of the problems are intended to be solvable, or at least possible to get some points. But all of them are extremely annoying.

It was super hot today! We had an excursion planned, but the RCs didn‚Äôt let us go because of the heat. This also meant that most people were pretty lethargic, and obviously there were no outdoor sports. One good thing was ‚ÄúLightning Talks‚Äù, where people sign up to give short 4-minute presentations. People kept signing up during the event, and we ended up having 40 talks in total. I did eight of them! Some notable ones: I told a long joke about pizzas and tacos, Leo and I speedran factorization theory and got Samuel to admit orz with a card ‚Äútrick‚Äù, and I presented about ultraproducts. Karn did a lot of ‚Äúmorally incorrect‚Äù geometry, Samuel had a really cool geo presentation about the British Flag Theorem, and Oron, me and Tiger sang ‚ÄúCombination Pizza Hut and Taco Bell‚Äù a capella.

<p align="center"><img src="/images/mop12a.png" width="500"/> <br> <span style="color: gray"> Speakers for "lightning talks" &mdash; I am in 8 of the 40!  </span> </p>

I think that up untill just a few days ago, I was not fully tuned into the MOP experience. I would basically just go to classes, take tests, and play frisbee and cards; I didn‚Äôt really get to interact with other people. But starting from a few days ago, I‚Äôve begun to utilize all the things that I can do at MOP that I can‚Äôt do at home. For example: playing ‚ÄúCombination‚Äù with Oron and Tiger in the music rooms, attending storytime, working on the RELMO with Dotted, and more. I am having so much fun now; I wasn‚Äôt even able to sleep yesterday!

<br>

## Day 13 &mdash; Monday, June 23, 2025

### Alex Song class, Yi Sun talks, Mafia, MOP graph.

Today we had a class called ‚ÄúA fun problem‚Äù by Alex Song, which was an Euler-Circle style Dirichlet character problem. It was fun to revisit the subject. We then had a class called ‚ÄúCombinatorial Geometry‚Äù, which is my favorite subject. Unfortunately, it was more like geometrical combo: it was about the combinatorial aspects of triangulations, which is less interesting for me. I prefer a more geometrical approach, like the Thaiangulations problem. We also had a talk by Yi Sun about zero-knowledge proof. Unfortunately, I didn‚Äôt understand much. I somehow don‚Äôt understand finance ‚Äúmoney math‚Äù very well. 

After this, I went with Oron to jam in the music rooms. We later got Karn and Tiger, and for some reason Liam and Jonathan also came into the room (even though they hate the song that we were playing). It was pretty fun, and we made a lot of progress. 

Jonathan has a funny app on his phone which lets him scan objects to get a 3D picture of them. He used it to make a funny video of Oron and me spinning around. We look like action figures.

<p align="center"><img src="/images/mop13b.png" width="300"/> </p>

Its still super hot, so today it got a bit boring at times. There was an assembly in the evening, which was fun; Dotted announced that the RELMO would be on Wednesday and Friday. I‚Äôm excited to see the returners‚Äô (especially Liam's) reactions to the problems. We played Frisbee after the assembly, which was pretty fun. 

David Fox is organizing Mafia, which is starting tonight; I‚Äôm a ‚Äútown vigilante‚Äù, which means that I get to kill people! (not irl of course). 

<p align="center"><img src="/images/mop13c.jpg" width="400"/> <br> <span style="color: gray"> David Fox </span> </p>

Catherine Xu is making a digraph of students at MOP and their crushes, but it turns out that all 38 responses to the form so far are trolls. One of them was ‚Äúeveryone‚Äù likes ‚ÄúAlexander Wang‚Äù.  

<p align="center"><img src="/images/mop13a.png" width="400"/> <br> <span style="color: gray"> Catherine Xu </span> </p>

Karn Chutinan is a fun person to talk to. He somehow knew ‚ÄúCombination Pizza Hut and Taco Bell‚Äù from before MOP, and he also plays improv piano like Oron does. His playing is extremely funny (you heard that right &mdash; piano playing _can_ be funny). He sometimes self-deprecates though, and he is a bit moody sometimes.

Another camp called ‚ÄúPromise‚Äù is at IMSA now, and it‚Äôs pretty big. IMSA‚Äôs  PROMISE Program addresses the unique challenges of culturally, linguistically, and economically diverse (CLED) students interested in STEM education by providing academic enrichment programming at low to no cost. There are lots of middle schoolers. This means that we have to share the dining hall, and somehow our lunch period got cut to just 30 minutes! 

Today is the day before TSTST. People seem to be less worried about it than I expected; but of course some people are locked in. These people include Liam, Jonathan, me, and Yoll (he really wants to make TST group). I don‚Äôt know if Oron is locked in or not; he is generally kind of silly all the time. On the other hand, many people are just going on with their day as usual. I guess that for many people, MOP is the pinnacle of their HS career. But not for me (I hope)!

## Day 14 &mdash; Tuesday, June 24, 2025

### TSTST Day 1, two MOPpers expelled, Tiger Zhang, introspection.

Today was TSTST Day 1, but let me not get ahead of myself here. Let's start with the AM classes. We had an interesting class about projective geometry, which is going to be a warm-up for moving points. It was taught without using any lengths, and the instructor asked me to present my solution to one of the exercises. It ended with the statement of DIT (but there were no applications to olympiad problems in this class).

Now for TSTST-1: I solved P1 in less than 10 minutes, and P2 was a functional equation similar to an ISL problem that I had seen before. It took a bit less than two hours. P3 turned out to be an anti-problem, but I was actually quite close. If I had written down every single one of my ideas, I might have gotten a couple more points.

Tiger Zhang is one of the most mature people at MOP, but he also has a silly side. He was one of the first people to appreciate ‚ÄúCombination‚Äù, and he likes to banter. He‚Äôs generally pretty quiet, but he‚Äôs not shy at all. 

<p align="center"><img src="/images/mop14.png" width="400"/> <br> <span style="color: gray"> Tiger (Qiao) Zhang </span> </p>

Today there was a lot of drama. Apparently some RC saw footage of two people kissing in the hall commons between 12:00 and 3:00 (when you‚Äôre not allowed to be inside). This resulted in the two people getting expelled from MOP (by IMSA and MAA; MOP staff fought hard for them), as well as the staff member who opened the door for them. Practically everyone at MOP is worked up about this and they did some kind of protest (where they went on an unauthorised walk to get food for the two people) in the evening.

On a more personal note, I had a long talk with Baba about my relationship with math, and me wasting my time and not paying attention to the math at MOP. I am going to do some introspection in the remainder of MOP and decide what I am going to do going forward. I think that I want to do math, but I need to be stronger about my commitments.
