Reached Chicago a few days early and stayed at *The Chicago Marriott Southwest at Burr Ridge* – fantastic hotel! Our room overlooked a beautiful view with a pond within a lush green rolling meadow.

Dinner on Sunday was pizza at _Stix and Stones_ which was incredible. <br> On Monday I met with Isaac at Univ. of Chicago.

In the evening, we had a fabulous dinner at _Kama Bistro_ --- black pepper lamb and achari chicken. I met with Arun on Tuesday at _Cupitol Coffee & Eatery_. We then had lunch at _Momo Factory_. Wednesday morning, mama and baba dropped me off at Terminal 2 of the Chicago O'Hare International Airport for the 1145AM shuttle to IMSA.

## [Day 1](#day-1)

### Wednedsay, June 11, 2025.

A bunch of MOPpers started throwing olympiad problems at each other when we were roaming through the IMSA halls. It was quite fun!

The general community at MOP is quite friendly and inclusive. People play a lot of cards, and we also played pickleball.

Our rooms are pretty good; exactly like the pictures Hannah shared. We overlook a really nice view from the window. I’m sharing the room with Evan Fan, another junior. I like him quite a bit, and he reminds me of Allen Li from physics camp.

Yoll is exactly like Jerry Guo, but nicer I think; he is also quite funny! I will be going for a run in the morning with Liam. 

I’m excited for MOP. I think that I will have a great time, and make a lot of friends.


## [Day 2](#day-2)

### Thursday, June 12, 2025.

We had our first MOP classes today: on prime powers and hidden graphs in combo problems. I enjoyed both of them, and what I really appreciated were the little insights that the instructors gave us while walking us through the solutions. I also presented my 17-page solution in MOP homework review.

MOP loves to play sports! I went for a run with Liam, Tiger, and Aryan in the morning. I think that this is going to be the running group. All four of us are serious. I also played basketball for an hour, and then played Frisbee for an hour. I played for 3 hours today ... would make Baba proud!

ELMO teams were decided; Jonathan told me I was in the first draft.

There are 7 teams in ELMO and they compete for the best score. Its a team captain format &mdash; each captain is one of the returners. I found out that I'm on team **Xooks** (captains: Calvin Wang and Oron Wang) and my team id is XOO7 ... so I guess that makes me James Bond!

I met Aryan Raj on the bus to IMSA. I like talking to him a lot; I think it is because we are on the same wavelength about many things.

I had a lot of fun at MOP today. Tomorrow is our first test. Time to lock in!

## [Day 3](#day-3)

### Friday, June 13, 2025.

The MOP classes today were both lecture-based: we had an inequalities class, which was just analysis and Lagrange multipliers, and a class on cubic curves which was very interesting, but I have no clue how to apply it. We also had our first MOP test, which I did reasonably well on (expecting 750). I spent a lot of time on P2 with a completely wrong idea but I ultimately figured it out. However I didn't have time to fully finish the writeup &mdash; I got to a point where the finish is quite easy. Also, my solution has a small (patchable) error.

We had a 2-Sigma dinner, where they gave a presentation and also got us free boba. The boba was good, but Arun’s explanation of what quants do was much better than the presentation.

Today I found out that Liam skipped two grades &mdash; just like me! He is a very nice person, and he cares about other people. He will always help you out if you ask him.

ELMO is tomorrow. I’m feeling good about it &mdash; coming in strong after the MOP test. I will skip my run tomorrow&mdash;after all, it’s Saturday. I will also be doing my laundry.
