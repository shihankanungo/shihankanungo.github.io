### Day 15 &mdash; Wednesday, June 25, 2025

<details>
<summary><b>Rest Day 1, Team contest, drama continues, Leo Hong.</b></summary> 
<br>
Today was a rest day between TSTST 1 and 2. Instead of the AM Classes, we had a Team Contest. It was like a guts round, except for olympiad problems. My team consisted of Oron, Tiger, Grant, Karn, and Brian (an international from Singapore). Everyone except me and Brian were geo mains, which was kind of funny. I spent a lot of time on problem 2, which was a very tricky combo problem. Grant was working on it, and then Tiger also tried it with me. I was finally able to get it, and I’m proud of my solution. I then spent the remainder of the time on an inequality, which I used Lagrange Multipliers on. I got really close, but I was not able to resolve the last inequality (which was pretty much just a bash) in time to present my solution to the graders. We also had a class on the derivatives on polynomials. Unfortunately I got stuck on one problem and I was not able to get it.
<br><br>
The drama from yesterday is escalating: Evan (Chen) is leaving MOP! The overwhelming sentiment is now that IMSA+MAA = evil and MOP is becoming like 1984/Animal Farm. I disagree strongly with everyone else. I think that the punishment was deserved and certainly not worth the outcry: rules are rules, we do not know all the facts or even most of them, and I think that IMSA and MAA were just doing their job. 
<br><br>  
On a brighter note, I attended Karn’s PowerPoint karaoke session, where people present a slideshow they’ve never seen before. I submitted my superalgebra presentation. I presented Royce’s submission, which was a super weird hodgepodge of random images and words.

<p align="center"><img src="/images/mop15a.png" width="700"/> <br> <span style="color: gray"> Scenes from PowerPoint Karaoke. </span> </p>

I talked to Leo Hong for quite a bit during dinner today, and he has a very interesting story. His dad made him do math when he was younger, and even gave him punishments, like jump roping for three hours (because of this, Leo won some jump roping competitions when he was 10). But Leo actually really likes to do math now. Unfortunately, his dad now wants him to play basketball at Chapel Hill for college and get a girlfriend. And both of these take priority over math. Leo wants to do math (he likes basketball, but he just does it for fun). I’m not sure if Leo has a good time at home; he says that a summer away from his dad is heaven for him, and he would not know how to deal with another summer at home. Leo’s also much more mature than he lets on. Out of the many people I talked to about the expulsion situation, he’s the only person who independently has the same viewpoint as me. He says that he’s done a lot of thinking about morals and ethics, and I think I see a lot of myself in him. 

<p align="center"><img src="/images/mop15.jpg" width="700"/> <br> <span style="color: gray"> ... with Leo Hong. </span> </p>

I’m having a much better time at MOP now that I’m focused on my priorities. Even though I’m doing less “fun stuff”, I think that my interactions are more meaningful, such as talking to Leo. I also feel more satisfied; when you put energy into something, it gives you a feeling like nothing else.

### Day 14 &mdash; Tuesday, June 24, 2025

<details>
<summary><b>TSTST Day 1, two MOPpers expelled, Tiger Zhang, introspection.</b></summary>  
<br>
Today was TSTST Day 1, but let me not get ahead of myself here. Let's start with the AM classes. We had an interesting class about projective geometry, which is going to be a warm-up for moving points. It was taught without using any lengths, and the instructor asked me to present my solution to one of the exercises. It ended with the statement of DIT (but there were no applications to olympiad problems in this class).
<br><br>
Now for TSTST-1: I solved P1 in less than 10 minutes, and P2 was a functional equation similar to an ISL problem that I had seen before. It took a bit less than two hours. P3 turned out to be an anti-problem, but I was actually quite close. If I had written down every single one of my ideas, I might have gotten a couple more points.
<br><br>
Tiger Zhang is one of the most mature people at MOP, but he also has a silly side. He was one of the first people to appreciate “Combination”, and he likes to banter. He’s generally pretty quiet, but he’s not shy at all. 

<p align="center"><img src="/images/mop14.png" width="400"/> <br> <span style="color: gray"> Tiger (Qiao) Zhang </span> </p>

Today there was a lot of drama. Apparently some RC saw footage of two people kissing in the hall commons between 12:00 and 3:00 (when you’re not allowed to be inside). This resulted in the two people getting expelled from MOP (by IMSA and MAA; MOP staff fought hard for them), as well as the staff member who opened the door for them. Practically everyone at MOP is worked up about this and they did some kind of protest (where they went on an unauthorised walk to get food for the two people) in the evening.
<br><br>
On a more personal note, I had a long talk with Baba about my relationship with math, and me wasting my time and not paying attention to the math at MOP. I am going to do some introspection in the remainder of MOP and decide what I am going to do going forward. I think that I want to do math, but I need to be stronger about my commitments. <br>

### Day 13 &mdash; Monday, June 23, 2025

<details>
<summary><b>Alex Song class, Yi Sun talks, Mafia, MOP graph, Karn Chutinan.</b></summary> 
<br>
Today we had a class called “A fun problem” by Alex Song, which was an Euler-Circle style Dirichlet character problem. It was fun to revisit the subject. We then had a class called “Combinatorial Geometry”, which is my favorite subject. Unfortunately, it was more like geometrical combo: it was about the combinatorial aspects of triangulations, which is less interesting for me. I prefer a more geometrical approach, like the Thaiangulations problem. We also had a talk by Yi Sun about zero-knowledge proof. Unfortunately, I didn’t understand much. I somehow don’t understand finance “money math” very well. 
<br><br>
After this, I went with Oron to jam in the music rooms. We later got Karn and Tiger, and for some reason Liam and Jonathan also came into the room (even though they hate the song that we were playing). It was pretty fun, and we made a lot of progress. 
<br><br>
Jonathan has a funny app on his phone which lets him scan objects to get a 3D picture of them. He used it to make a funny video of Oron and me spinning around. We look like action figures.

<p align="center"><img src="/images/mop13b.png" width="300"/> </p>

Its still super hot, so today it got a bit boring at times. There was an assembly in the evening, which was fun; Dotted announced that the RELMO would be on Wednesday and Friday. I’m excited to see the returners’ (especially Liam's) reactions to the problems. We played Frisbee after the assembly, which was pretty fun. 
<br><br>
David Fox is organizing Mafia, which is starting tonight; I’m a “town vigilante”, which means that I get to kill people! (not irl of course). 

<p align="center"><img src="/images/mop13c.jpg" width="400"/> <br> <span style="color: gray"> David Fox </span> </p>

Catherine Xu is making a digraph of students at MOP and their crushes, but it turns out that all 38 responses to the form so far are trolls. One of them was “everyone” likes “Alexander Wang”.  

<p align="center"><img src="/images/mop13a.png" width="400"/> <br> <span style="color: gray"> Catherine Xu </span> </p>

Karn Chutinan is a fun person to talk to. He somehow knew “Combination Pizza Hut and Taco Bell” from before MOP, and he also plays improv piano like Oron does. His playing is extremely funny (you heard that right &mdash; piano playing _can_ be funny). He sometimes self-deprecates though, and he is a bit moody sometimes.
<br><br>
Another camp called “PROMISE” is at IMSA now, and it’s pretty big. IMSA’s PROMISE Program addresses the unique challenges of culturally, linguistically, and economically diverse (CLED) students interested in STEM education by providing academic enrichment programming at low to no cost. There are lots of middle schoolers. This means that we have to share the dining hall, and somehow our lunch period got cut to just 30 minutes! 
<br><br>
Today is the day before TSTST. People seem to be less worried about it than I expected; but of course some people are locked in. These people include Liam, Jonathan, me, and Yoll (he really wants to make TST group). I don’t know if Oron is locked in or not; he is generally kind of silly all the time. On the other hand, many people are just going on with their day as usual. I guess that for many people, MOP is the pinnacle of their HS career. But not for me (I hope)! <br>

### Day 12 &mdash; Sunday, June 22, 2025

<details>
<summary><b>2nd Free Day! Lightning talks, seminar.</b></summary> 
<br>
Today was Sunday &mdash; a free day! Yay! There were no classes and no tests. The only math-related thing I did was work on the RELMO with Dotted. We have 12 problems, which is perfect: we can do a RELMO with 6 and a RELSMO with the other 6. Tony Lu gave us a really nice problem based on his PRIMES research with Prof. Gotti. Most of the problems are intended to be solvable, or at least possible to get some points. But all of them are extremely annoying.
<br><br>
It was super hot today! We had an excursion planned, but the RCs didn’t let us go because of the heat. This also meant that most people were pretty lethargic, and obviously there were no outdoor sports. One good thing was “Lightning Talks”, where people sign up to give short 4-minute presentations. People kept signing up during the event, and we ended up having 40 talks in total. I did eight of them! Some notable ones: I told a long joke about pizzas and tacos, Leo and I speedran factorization theory and got Samuel to admit orz with a card “trick”, and I presented about ultraproducts. Karn did a lot of “morally incorrect” geometry, Samuel had a really cool geo presentation about the British Flag Theorem, and Oron, me and Tiger sang “Combination Pizza Hut and Taco Bell” a capella.

<p align="center"><img src="/images/mop12a.png" width="500"/> <br> <span style="color: gray"> Speakers for "lightning talks" &mdash; I am in 8 of the 40!  </span> </p>

I think that up untill just a few days ago, I was not fully tuned into the MOP experience. I would basically just go to classes, take tests, and play frisbee and cards; I didn’t really get to interact with other people. But starting from a few days ago, I’ve begun to utilize all the things that I can do at MOP that I can’t do at home. For example: playing “Combination” with Oron and Tiger in the music rooms, attending storytime, working on the RELMO with Dotted, and more. I am having so much fun now; I wasn’t even able to sleep yesterday!

### Day 11 &mdash; Saturday, June 21, 2025

<details>
<summary><b>ELMO Day 2, story-time, Rohan Garg.</b></summary>  
<br>
Today was ELMO day 2. P4 was a geo problem; we had to prove that a circle and a line were tangent. Unfortunately, my diagram had an inaccuracy, so I spent the first hour not realizing that the tangency point was a point already in the diagram. Then I knew it would be an angle chase; which proved to be a bit tricky. I got it relatively easily though. P5 was a number theory problem, which I fakesolved at first. But since I knew that I was going to make a mistake, I carefully checked my solution and caught the error. I then proceeded to fix it and get a correct solution. P6 was a combo problem which looked familiar, but I wasn’t able to make much nontrivial progress. It turns out that no one solved it; in fact no one (including the IMO team) but the proposer of the problem was able to do so. I was a bit bummed, because this meant that I would lose to Royce Yao by 2 points in the overall ELMO. But I guess this is my fault: I missed 3 completely gettable points on P1. 
<br><br>
Today was a relaxed day; nothing much besides the ELMO happened. We had pizza for dinner after the ELMO, and we also had storytime. There were not many people at storytime, but it was still fun. 

<p align="center"><img src="/images/mop11b.jpg" width="300"/> <br> <span style="color: gray"> Just got out of storytime ... </span> </p>

Now even the staff know about Combination Pizza Hut and Taco Bell! I think it was because I put it on all of my MOP Test 3 solutions. Some people also made a trio of polls on the MOP server: “I’m at the Pizza Hut”, “I’m at the Taco Bell”, “I’m at the combination pizza hut and taco bell”. As of Saturday evening, it has 15 likes and only 5 thumbs downs. 

<p align="center"><img src="/images/mop11.png" width="400"/> <br> <span style="color: gray"> Polls in the MOP discord server </span> </p>

Rohan Garg is a pretty chill guy. He’s not a super excitable person like many other MOPpers, but he does like to talk, especially while playing cards. He is a "geo super-antimain", and say’s that he’s an NT main, but he solved the geo and didn’t solve the NT on this test…

<p align="center"><img src="/images/mop11a.png" width="300"/> <br> <span style="color: gray"> Rohan Garg </span> </p>

ELMO Day 2 went well, but I still made a mistake (even though I caught it). I need to figure out how to stay calm, and do everything correctly the first time. <br>

### Day 10 &mdash; Friday, June 20, 2025

<details>
<summary><b>Picture Day!! Problem Solving Geometry, and Probabilistic method; Alexander Wang.</b></summary>  
<br>
Today was picture day!! 

<p align="center"><img src="/images/mop10.jpg" width="700"/> <br> <span style="color: gray"> MOP 2025 on the bleachers!!. </span> </p>

I also have a surprise for baba — I said I won’t tell him what till the talent show. It's going to be a surprise. It will involve me and Oron playing improv piano.
<br><br>
The classes today were super good! Our first class was “Problem Solving Geometry”, taught by Brian Lawrence. There were no configs, big theorems or bashing; just pure geo. I really liked how he told us to pay attention to how we got unstuck on a problem, and made a list of questions to ask ourselves. I think that if I use these ideas, I can become very good at synthetic geo.  We next had a probabilistic method class taught by Milan, and Jiahe and I solved an RMM 3 in two different ways! We even generalized the problem. Finally, Jordan gave us a True/False class, where each question becomes easy once you’re convinced what the answer is. I spent a lot of time on a problem involving Liam and Tiger playing a game; but I wasn’t able to get it. I’ll keep thinking about it because Jordan said it was a nice problem.
<br><br>
Alexander Wang is not very mature, but he’s nice to talk to once you get to know him. He’s a loud person, and he tends to be at the center of the conversation (but not in a bad way!). He’s also quite good at piano; we heard him practicing when Tiger, Oron, and I were in the music rooms. Tiger and Oron are also very good; I think that Tiger is the best. 

<p align="center"><img src="/images/mop10a.jpg" width="400"/> <br> <span style="color: gray"> Alexander Wang aka <i>dottedcaculator</i> </span> </p>

I’ve made far too many mistakes on the tests. Tomorrow is ELMO, and the TSTSTs are coming up. No more fooling around. I need to be 100% focused on the tests and make sure that I perform to the peak of my ability. <br>

### Day 9 &mdash; Thursday, June 19, 2025

<details>
<summary><b>MOP Test 3, "Combination Pizza Hut and Taco Bell", ANT, Jiahe Liu, story-time.</b></summary> 
<br>
MOP Test 3 was today; I was able to solve P1 quite easily using _Combination Pizza Hut and Taco Bell_; essentially, we had a sequence with two properties and I called the first one _Pizza Hut_ and the second one _Taco Bell_. P2 was a hard geo problem (which only Tiger solved synthetically; everyone else complex bashed or used the isoptic cubic) &mdash; I just submitted the lyrics to _Combination Pizza Hut and Taco Bell_; I’m hoping to get a style score satisfying x(1-x)=0. P3 was a combo problem which I fakesolved (argh!!). I got the first idea, which was to make it a graph, but I thought there was only one possibility for the graph. I had even checked and rewritten my solution, but I didn’t catch the mistake. I believe I would have solved the problem if I had caught the mistake.
<br><br>
We had a class on analytic number theory, and the problem set was exactly like in Euler Circle: the problems were super hard and there was even an open problem! One of the problems was to show that every Diophantine equation is equivalent to a quartic. 
<br><br>
Jiahe is very good at both olympiad math and theory; like me. In all of the non-geo theory classes, we are usually the ones answering all the questions. For example, in the entropy class, the instructor at one point asked a question and said “could somebody who is not one of the two people who’ve been answering everything please tell us how to do this?”

<p align="center"><img src="/images/mop9.png" width="400"/> <br> <span style="color: gray"> Jiahe Liu </span> </p>

I attended storytime today. The discussions were quite stimulating. We talked about old- vs. new MOP; how COVID affected math olympiads; Zuming Feng stories; and more. I’m glad that I attended, and I’ll definitely go again.
<br><br>
Tomorrow, I will ask Evan Chen to make me a geo bashing handout. I’ve realized that I might become a geo antimain if I’m not careful. That’s something I do not want to be. <br>

### Day 8 &mdash; Wednesday, June 18, 2025

<details>
<summary><b>RELMO, Jane Street, Grant Blitz, "Combination Pizza Hut and Taco Bell".</b></summary>  
<br>
I worked on my RELMO problems today. It’s not easy to write problems; even if you’re trying to make them as bad as possible. I have a problem taken from my Geneson project; unfortunately I don’t know how to solve it. I was able to finish the second one; about the S-matrix conjecture.
<br><br>
I like talking to Grant Blitz. He is refreshingly “not-asian” and his voice is very nice to listen to. He is a geo-main, and he goes to Exeter, just like Evan Fan. I think he is a very unselfish person; and he cares about others.
<br><br>
Today, I started singing “Combination Pizza Hut and Taco Bell” in class, and now it’s become kind of a meme. My favorite target was Oron, but he went home and listened to the song; and now he’s my partner in crime.
<br><br>
We had Jane Street today &mdash; the estimathon was unbelievably hard! My team came in second-to-last!!

<p align="center"><img src="/images/mop8.png" width="500"/> <br> <span style="color: gray"> Estimathon! L to R: Daniel, Kevin, Tarun, Aryan, (also Michael, Oron). </span> </p>

MOP test 3 is tomorrow; I want to make this my “comeback”. I would like to solve a hard problem; a problem that I’m proud of doing. <br>

### Day 7 &mdash; Tuesday, June 17, 2025

<details>
<summary><b>MOP Test 2, Yoll Feng, story-time.</b></summary> 
<br>
MOP Test 2 was today. Problem 1 was an anti-problem!!!! I spent almost 3 hours on it, and I seriously thought that I was going to get swept. But I got it eventually. Unfortunately, I didn’t have time to solve P2, which was hard. I had all the right ideas though, and if I had more time I think I would have got it. It turns out that I was kind of right to be scared &mdash; Jonathan and Oron both got swept, and I am predicting 720. 
<br><br>
We had classes on determinants and entropy today; they were both interesting, although the problems felt a bit like AIME problems &mdash; i.e., computational.
<br><br>
I think Yoll Feng looks up to me; he has often expressed concern about the TSTST and asked me for advice. And today he asked me for some of my “orzness” before the test. I told him that he’d do fine.
<br><br>
Today was storytime; I had completely forgotten about it. I hadn’t checked my computer the whole day since I didn’t take it in my bag, so I didn’t see Baba’s message. I went after I called Baba and I saw the message, but it was too late. Hopefully, I will catch another one before MOP ends.
<br><br>
In this MOP test, I didn’t make any mistakes. However, I think that I might have spent a bit too much time on P1 going down a rabbit hole. I think that I should remember to stop and look for alternate approaches; I sometimes trust my intuition too much. <br>

### Day 6 &mdash; Monday, June 16, 2025

<details>
<summary><b>Spiral similarity, Alexander Wang, RELMO committee, Connor Leong.</b></summary> 
<br>
Today we had a class by Vivian Loh on spiral similarity! (Baba’s favorite subject). The class was interesting but the examples were just begging to be complex bashed. 
<details>
<summary><b>Spiral Similarity. Problem</b></summary>
  <img src="/images/mop6p.png" width="700"/>
</details>
Then we had two consecutive classes on polynomials. Polynomials 1 was taught by Victor Wang. The problems were too notation heavy. The first one had a nerfed version of ELMO P3 on the first problem, and the second had Decartes’ Rule of Signs 💀. Polynomials 2 was taught by Eric Larson. It was slightly easier to understand.
<details>
<summary><b>Polynomials I & II. Problems</b></summary>
  <img src="/images/mop6pa.png" width="700"/>
</details> 
I also talked to Dotted about RELMO, and it turns out that we both ripped a problem from our PRIMES projects, and they are both about extremal functions.
<br><br>
Connor Leong is an excellent Frisbee player. After the ELMO, he said that my P3 submission was “brilliant” multiple times. Also, when we play Frisbee, if we are on opposite teams, he always guards me and if we are on the same team, he always dabs me up when we score a point. I think that he likes me a lot, and I like him too. He is part of the "cards group”, which also includes Vihaan, Rohan, David (who is probably the best at Frisbee), Ryan, and Kailua. I’ve started joining them for cards in the past few days.

<p align="center"><img src="/images/mop6a.png" width="500"/> <br> <span style="color: gray"> Connor Leong </span> </p>

Our second Assembly was today. We voted on the MOP t-shirt. There were 3 designs: one about a cross-section of a cube (which had nothing to do with the USAMO), one with the letters M,O,S,P in a grid, and one which had the words MOSP and YAY which looked like they were written with a computer mouse, and a graph symbolizing USAMO P2. I wanted the last one to win, but alas common sense prevailed and the first one won. 
<br><br>
Yesterday, I was able to get a sound sleep by wrapping a shirt around my eyes as an eye mask, and playing Max Richter “Sleep” on my earbuds. I think that I will do that for the rest of camp. Baba has also ordered an eye mask for me, which I will probably get tomorrow.

### Day 5 &mdash; Sunday, June 15, 2025

<details>
<summary><b>First free day, ELMO coordination, Jonathan Du, excursion.</b></summary> 
<br>
Today was an off day: there were no classes (except for a seminar on elliptic integrals). But ELMO coordination was in full swing. Calvin spent 5 hours arguing with Liam about our team’s problem 1 submissions, and a good bit of that was on mine. They were debating whether to give a 4 or a 5. I felt that I should have got a 5, but due to the way that other peoples solutions were graded, we had to settle on a 4. But this caused me to decide to join in participating in writing the RELMO, and I’ve started working on a problem which imitates ELMO P2 and my p1 coordination, except in the problem I win.
<br><br>
I hang out with Jonathan quite a bit; we often sit together during MOP classes. He has an extremely good sense of humor and often makes very funny jokes. 
<br><br>
Today Jiahe organized a walk where a bunch of people went on an “excursion” to a place with a bunch of restaurants. I planned on going, but I was talking with Calvin about ELMO coordination when they left.

I have made too many silly mistakes on the tests: 3 out of 5 problems I attempted. I think I need to sleep earlier so that I don’t get woken up by random noises, and I also need to be calmer during the tests. <br>

<details>
<summary><b>ELMO Day 1, Oron Wang, quantumelectrodynamics.</b></summary> 
<br>
First class was NT about stuff of the form <i>x<sup>n</sup>-y<sup>n</sup></i>. It was taught by John Berman. It was interesting and had some cyclotomic polynomial stuff. At the end there was this one problem of Erdös that had a crazy black magic feeling solution. A problem i liked:

</details>
Second class was a Geometry class taught by Rachel Zhang about expansion which is a weird technique in geo (and NOT anything else). Basically the idea is to orient all lines and circles, then expansion is to increase the radius of all circles and lines in a directed sense. This way, tangencies are preserved, and nice stuff can happen if you turn some circles into points. Here are some problems

<summary><b>Geo Transformations. Problems</b></summary>
  <img src="/images/mop4pa.png" width="600"/>
</details>
Today was ELMO day 1. Dotted decided to troll us by making the ELMO as the “Error-Littered Math Olympiad”, where all the problems were covered with random error messages and one of them was in Japanese. The ELSMO (which is supposed to be the troll version) was the “Elmo Loves Swapping Math Olympiads”, and was the actual test. I got P1 pretty quickly: it was an arrow problem. P2 was easy for me as well, mostly because I was able to reduce it to a problem from the Blue MOP combinatorics class (which I had solved). I then proceeded to spend 3 hours on P3, continually fakesolving and patching my solution until I finally got it. But right after the test, I realized that I got the wrong answer, and then someone pointed out that I misread the problem. It turns out that this happened to a bunch of people, and I was feeling very grumpy about that. But, in the evening, as Dotted was going through our team’s P3 submissions, he said that I should get a 4 or a 5 (which would be one of the top scores)! It turns out that my solution was on the right track, and most of it actually matched the official (correct) solution! So I’m feeling good now! Yay!
<br><br>
Oron is a very interesting character. Whenever he is working on a problem he starts randomly saying the words "Yay", "Spam", and "Buh". Someone said that MOP has a tradition of degen a few days ago. I think this is it.

Today Grant Blitz and I were able to figure out who <i>quantumelectrodynamics</i> (QED) was. A lot of people have been trying to find out, and yesterday Liam and Oron concluded that it was an alt account. At breakfast, Grant saw that QED was online, so I asked him to text QED "are u at breakfast?" to which QED replied "yes", so we immediately looked around to see who was on their phones. But then QED went offline, so we looked to see who had just put away their phone. There was one person who did: it was Dotted. We then sent him a few more texts, and the online/offline and typing patterns exactly matched! Dotted still won’t admit that he’s QED though.
<br><br>
Tomorrow is an off day: no classes or tests. It will be nice to relax and just hang out.  <br>

### Day 3 &mdash; Friday, June 13, 2025

<details>
<summary><b>MOP Test 1, cubic curves, 2-sigma, Liam Reddy.</b></summary> 
<br>
The MOP classes today were both lecture-based. First class was Inequalities 1 with Alex (Zhuo Qun) Song. It was actually just an intro to Lagrange multipliers. Almost all of the class was theory and we only did one problem:

<summary><b>Inequalities 1. Problem</b></summary>

</details>
The second class was probably the best overall class that MOP will ever see. Evan Chen taught a class on Cubic curves. First he talked about Cayley-Bacharach, both cubic and quartic, then a little about the circle points, and then he went over isoptic and isopivotal cubics. However, I have no clue how to apply any of this to olympiad problems. The problems were very fun.

</details>

We also had our first MOP test, which I did reasonably well on (expecting 750). I spent a lot of time on P2 with a completely wrong idea but I ultimately figured it out. However I didn't have time to fully finish the writeup &mdash; I got to a point where the finish is quite easy. Also, my solution has a small (patchable) error.
<br><br>
We had a 2-Sigma dinner, where they gave a presentation and also got us free boba. The boba was good, but Arun’s explanation of what quants do was much better than the presentation.
<br><br>
Today I found out that Liam skipped two grades &mdash; just like me! He is a very nice person, and he cares about other people. He will always help you out if you ask him.

ELMO is tomorrow. I’m feeling good about it &mdash; coming in strong after the MOP test. I will skip my run tomorrow&mdash;after all, it’s Saturday. I will also be doing my laundry. <br>

### Day 2 &mdash; Thursday, June 12, 2025

<details>
<summary><b>First day of classes, run group, ELMO teams, Aryan Raj.</b></summary> 
<br>
We had our first MOP classes today: on prime powers and hidden graphs in combo problems. The class on prime powers was taught by Jordan Lefkowitz. I sat at a table with Michael, Jonathan, Oron, Grant and Jason. There were several funny problems. 
<details>
<summary><b>Prime Powers. Problems</b></summary>
  <img src="/images/mop2p.png" width="500"/>
</details>
Except, instead of only doing the problems we also said stuff like "those who know" while we were doing them. yay <br>
The combinatorics class was with Milan Haiman. The theme of the class was graphs and the problems were pretty hard&mdash; P1 was >=20 mohs. One interesting problem:
<details>
<summary><b>Combinatorics. 2016 EGMO Problem 3</b></summary>
  <img src="/images/mop2pa.png" width="500"/>
</details>
  
I enjoyed both the classes, and what I really appreciated were the little insights that the instructors gave us while walking us through the solutions. I also presented my 17-page solution in MOP homework review.
<br><br>
MOP loves to play sports! I went for a run with Liam, Tiger, and Aryan in the morning. I think that this is going to be the running group. All four of us are serious. I also played basketball for an hour, and then played Frisbee for an hour. I played for 3 hours today ... would make Baba proud!
<br><br>
ELMO teams were decided; Jonathan told me I was in the first draft. 

<p align="center"><img src="/images/mop2b.png" width="400"/> <br> <span style="color: gray"> with Jonathan Du </span> </p>

There are 7 teams in ELMO and they compete for the best score. Its a team captain format &mdash; each captain is one of the returners. I found out that I'm on team <b>Xooks</b> (captains: Calvin Wang and Oron Wang) and my team id is XOO7 ... so I guess that makes me James Bond!
<br><br>
I met Aryan Raj on the bus to IMSA. I like talking to him a lot; I think it is because we are on the same wavelength about many things.
<br><br>
I had a lot of fun at MOP today. Tomorrow is our first test. Time to lock in! <br>

### Day 1 &mdash; Wednesday, June 11, 2025

<details>
<summary><b>Rooms, Evan Fan, Yoll Feng.</b></summary>
<br>
Oron, Grant, and I decided to explore the main building&mdash;except we had no idea which entrance was actually the <i>main</i> one. So naturally, we ended up walking around the entire building before finally finding it.
<br><br>
We started off in the cafeteria, which was pretty big, and then tried to make our way to the academic wing. That… did not go smoothly. The place was basically a maze, and we got kind of lost. But we eventually found our classrooms, which looked pretty interesting. 
<br><br>
After that, we stumbled upon an open area with whiteboards and two very sad-looking markers. They were almost out of ink, but that didn’t stop Oron from drawing a Skibidi Toilet and an Amogus. As we were about to leave, we ran into some other people who were also exploring, so they joined us in the whiteboard zone. We started sharing our favorite problems—someone wrote up 2010 N3—and more people kept trickling in. Eventually, the whiteboards were completely filled with math problems (and a skibidi toilet and amogus). 
<br><br>
By that time, it was almost 5, so we headed to dinner. The food was (apparently) worse than last year, but honestly better than I expected, given how much the pre-MOPpers had complained.
<br><br>
The general community at MOP is quite friendly and inclusive. People play a lot of cards, and we also played pickleball.
<br><br>
Our rooms are pretty good; exactly like the pictures Hannah shared. We overlook a really nice view from the window. I’m sharing the room with Evan Fan, another junior. I like him quite a bit, and he reminds me of Allen Li from physics camp.

<p align="center"><img src="/images/mop1.png" width="400" /> <br> <span style="color: gray"> Evan Fan &mdash; my roommate! </span> </p> 

Yoll is exactly like Jerry Guo, but nicer I think; he is also quite funny! I will be going for a run in the morning with Liam. 
<br><br>
I’m excited for MOP. I think that I will have a great time, and make a lot of friends. <br>

### Day 0 &mdash; Sunday, June 8-11, 2025

<details>
<summary><b>Chicago, Isaac Chang, Arun Kannan.</b></summary>
<br>
Reached Chicago a few days early and stayed at <i>The Chicago Marriott Southwest at Burr Ridge</i> &mdash; which is a fantastic hotel! Our room overlooked a beautiful view with a pond within a lush green rolling meadow. 

<p align="center"><img src="/images/burr-ridge.png" width="500" /></p>

Dinner on Sunday was pizza at <i>Stix and Stones</i> which was incredible. <br> On Monday I met with Isaac Chang at the University of Chicago, where he is doing a triple major &mdash; Math, Physics, and CS!  

<p align="center"><img src="/images/isaac.jpg" width="400" /></p>

Isaac showed us around the campus and told us many interesting anecdotes. Mama took us to lunch at <i>West 57th</i>. In the evening, we had a fabulous dinner at <i>Kama Bistro</i> &mdash; black pepper lamb and achari chicken. I met with Arun on Tuesday at <i>Cupitol Coffee & Eatery</i>. For lunch, we went to <i>Momo Factory</i> followed by dinner at <i>Stix and Stones</i> (a repeat &mdash; yes it was that good!!). On Wednesday morning, mama and baba dropped me off at Terminal 2 of the Chicago O'Hare International Airport for the 1145AM shuttle to IMSA.
