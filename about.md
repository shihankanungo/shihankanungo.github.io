Hello! I am Shihan, a high school junior living in Palo Alto, CA. This is my website.

**Abstract.** In this project, we evaluate a multivariable family of infinite products which generalize Guillera's infinite product for $e$, and Ser's formula (rediscovered by Sondow) for $e^\gamma$. We describe formulas for the products in terms of special values of the Hurwitz zeta function $\zeta(s, u)$ and its $s$-derivative. Additionally, we derive integral and double integral representations for the logarithms of these infinite products.
