Hey! I'm Shihan&mdash;thanks for stopping by! I am a junior at high school living in Palo Alto, CA. I am fascinated by mathematics, physics, music (performing, composing, listening) and language. When I am not actually busy with one of these, I am probably pretending to be so, while secretly daydreaming about food. I aspire to nurture my passions and use them to make meaningful contributions to society. I truly believe that with curiosity, compassion, and creativity, we can address the challenges of today and build a brighter future&mdash;while having fun along the way! <br>

Each class is 10 weeks long and is the equivalent of a college mathematics class. In each class, we solve weekly problem sets to gain familiarity with new material, and at the end of the class we write an expository paper on a topic related to the class material. Classes at SJSU are 15 weeks long with 7 to 10 problem sets and two midterm exams and a final exam. In graduate classes, there is often a project and/or presentation in lieu of the final. <br>

When you're not being productive in a meaningful way, take a page from Cal Newport’s concept of “deep work.” Newport emphasizes the importance of sustained, undistracted focus on cognitively demanding tasks, helping ensure depth and mastery rather than superficial exploration. As Newport explains, 
> “In order for a session to count as deep work there must be zero distractions. Even a quick glance at your phone or email inbox can significantly reduce your performance due to the cost of context switching.”

When I’m learning about a new subject, for example, I set a timer, silence my devices and notifications, and aim to get into a state of flow. I try to immerse myself in the topic and let distractions and concerns fade into the background. Best case scenario? I lose track of time until the alarm pulls me back. After several focused learning sprints, however, I start to notice diminishing returns—my thoughts feel slower, and my brain begins to feel saturated. That’s when it’s time to switch gears and tackle a different task.
