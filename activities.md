> “It is the time you have wasted for your rose that makes your rose so important. <br>
&mdash; Antoine de Saint-Exupéry, The Little Prince

<br>
This is where I will keep track of what I am doing when I am not doing math &mdash; reading (fiction and non-fiction), listening (music), watching (movies), and travel. A lot of my time outside of math is spent playing music or composing music, but I still haven't figured out a good way to report that.
