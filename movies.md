I love watching movies, both in theaters (marked by 🎥 below), as well as at home &mdash; on Netflix, Prime Video, or on DVD. Yes, I still use DVDs. No, I will not be taking questions at this time.

Below is a lovingly curated list of movies I've watched *so far* this year&mdash;films I'd recommend to friends, strangers, time travelers, and probably even sworn enemies. If it’s listed here, it’s worth your time. If it’s marked with a 👍, it's a full-throated endorsement&mdash;like, stop-what-you're-doing-and-watch-it levels of enthusiasm. You're welcome in advance. Stay tuned for more!

With only a few gaps left, it seems like a fun end-of-year project to finish the set &mdash; one movie per missing year. I might as well try to fill in those remaining slots over the next few days and complete the streak (these will be indicated in bold font). This is my current wishlist:

- 2000: Almost Famous (d. Cameron Crowe) 2h 2m
- 2011: A Separation (d. Asghar Farhadi) 2h 3m
- 2013: Her (d. Spike Jonze) 2h 6m
- 2015: Mad Max: Fury Road (d. George Miller) 2h
- 2017: The Florida Project (d. Sean Baker) 1h 51m
- 2018: Roma (d. Alfonso Cuarón) 2h 15m
- 2019: They Shall Not Grow Old (d. Peter Jackson) 1h 39m
