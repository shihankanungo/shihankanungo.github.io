I love watching movies, both in theaters (marked by 🎥 below), as well as at home &mdash; on Netflix, Prime Video, or on DVD. Yes, I still use DVDs. No, I will not be taking questions at this time.

Below is a lovingly curated list of 1 movies I've watched *so far* this year&mdash;films I'd recommend to friends, strangers, time travelers, and probably even sworn enemies. If it’s listed here, it’s worth your time. If it’s marked with a 👍, it's a full-throated endorsement&mdash;like, stop-what-you're-doing-and-watch-it levels of enthusiasm. You're welcome in advance. Stay tuned for more!
