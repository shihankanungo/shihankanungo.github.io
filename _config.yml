  Hey! I'm Shihan&mdash;thanks for stopping by! I'm a high school junior from Palo Alto, CA, with a deep fascination for mathematics, physics, language, and music. I play the violin, love composing with my MPK Mini Plus, and have an eclectic taste in listening. When I am not actually engrossed in one of these, you will still find me pretending to be so, though secretly I will be daydreaming about food. I aspire to nurture my passions and use them to make meaningful contributions to society&mdash;while having fun doing so!
          <br /><br />

          <small><b>Sidenote</b>: <i>I'm looking to work on a hard research problem in combinatorics/graph theory. Please let me know if you, or someone you know, is interested in mentoring such a project! </i></small>
          
          <br /><br />
          <small><b>Recent news</b>: Mathematicians Wang Hong from NYU Courant, along with Joshua Zahl of the University of British Columbia, have solved an "infamous‚Äù geometry problem called the Kakeya conjecture within three dimensions. This conjecture asserts that a Kakeya set -- a subset of <b>R</b><sup>3</sup> that contains a unit line segment in every direction -- must have Minkowski and Hausdorff dimension equal to three. This is seen as a spectacular progress in geometric measure theory, and could also have implications for imaging, data processing, cryptography and wireless communication.</small>
