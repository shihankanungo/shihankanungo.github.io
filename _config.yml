  Hello! I am Shihan, a high school junior living in Palo Alto, CA. My interests are math, physics, music (I play classical and jazz violin and listen to a wide array of genres), reading, and food. 
  Hey! I'm Shihan; thanks for stopping by! I'm fascinated about mathematics and physics and music and language. I truly believe in the art of making for the betterment of the world while having fun doing so.
