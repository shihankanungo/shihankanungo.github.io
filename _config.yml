  Hello there! I’m Shihan&mdash;thanks for stopping by. I’m a high school junior from Palo Alto, CA, with a keen interest in mathematics, physics, language, and music. I play the violin, compose with my MPK Mini Plus, and have a music taste that defies genre (and occasionally logic). <br />When I’m not actively immersed in one of these pursuits, there’s a good chance I’m sitting very still, appearing contemplative&mdash;while secretly daydreaming about my next snack.<br /> I aspire to nurture my passions and use them to make meaningful contributions to the world ... ideally with a bit of joy, curiosity, and the occasional pastry along the way.
          <br /><br />

          <small><b>Recent news</b>: The 2025 International Mathematical Olympiad (IMO'25) will be held in Sunshine Coast, Australia from Jul 10&mdash;20, 2025.
