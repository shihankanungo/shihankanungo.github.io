  Hey! I'm Shihan&mdash;thanks for stopping by! I am a junior at high school living in Palo Alto, CA. I am fascinated by mathematics, physics, music (performing, composing, listening) and language. When I am not actually busy with one of these, I am probably pretending to be so, while secretly daydreaming about food. I aspire to nurture my passions and use them to make meaningful contributions to society. I truly believe that with curiosity, compassion, and creativity, we can address the challenges of today and build a brighter future&mdash;while having fun along the way!
          <br /><br />
