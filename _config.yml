  Hello there! I’m Shihan&mdash;thanks for stopping by. I live in Palo Alto, CA. I am deeply fascinated by mathematics, physics, language, and music. I play the violin, compose with my MPK Mini Plus, and have a music taste that defies genre (and occasionally logic). When I’m not actively immersed in one of these pursuits, there’s a good chance I’m sitting very still, appearing contemplative&mdash;while secretly daydreaming about my next snack. I aspire to nurture my passions and use them to make meaningful contributions to the world ... ideally with a bit of joy, curiosity, and the occasional pastry along the way.

          <small><b>Recent news</b>: <i></i> Origami Patterns Solve a Major Physics Riddle: In his recent work <i>Amplituhedra and Origami</i>, Pavel Galashin reveals a striking bijection between points of the momentum amplituhedron &mdash; an essential geometric tool for computing particle scattering amplitudes—and origami crease patterns. This breakthrough introduces a fresh combinatorial and polyhedral framework for understanding scattering amplitudes, recasting complex high-energy physics calculations into the language of discrete geometry and forging a new geometric bridge between particle-physics combinatorics and the mathematics of paper folding. </small>
