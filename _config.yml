  Hey! I'm Shihan&mdash;thanks for stopping by! I'm a high school junior from Palo Alto, CA, with a deep fascination for mathematics, physics, language, and music. I play the violin, love composing with my MPK Mini Plus, and have an eclectic taste in listening. When I am not actually engrossed in one of these, you will find me pretending to be so, though secretly I will be daydreaming about food. I aspire to nurture my passions and use them to make meaningful contributions to society&mdash;while having fun doing so!
          <br /><br />

          <small><b>Sidenote</b>: <i>I'm looking to work on a hard research problem in combinatorics/graph theory. Please let me know if you, or someone you know, is interested in mentoring such a project! </i></small>
