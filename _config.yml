  Hello there! I’m Shihan&mdash;thanks for stopping by. I live in Palo Alto, CA. I am deeply fascinated by mathematics, physics, language, and music. I play the violin, compose with my MPK Mini Plus, and have a music taste that defies genre (and occasionally logic). When I’m not actively immersed in one of these pursuits, there’s a good chance I’m sitting very still, appearing contemplative&mdash;while secretly daydreaming about my next snack. I aspire to nurture my passions and use them to make meaningful contributions to the world ... ideally with a bit of joy, curiosity, and the occasional pastry along the way.
