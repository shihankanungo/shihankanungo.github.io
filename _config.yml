  Hey! I'm Shihan&mdash;thanks for stopping by! I'm a high school junior from Palo Alto, CA, with a deep fascination for mathematics, physics, language, and music. I play the violin, love composing with my MPK Mini Plus, and have an eclectic taste in listening. When I am not actually engrossed in one of these, you will still find me pretending to be so, though secretly I will be daydreaming about food. I aspire to nurture my passions and use them to make meaningful contributions to society&mdash;while having fun doing so!
          <br /><br />

          <small><b>Sidenote</b>: <i>I'm looking to work on a hard research problem in combinatorics/graph theory. Please let me know if you, or someone you know, is interested in mentoring such a project! </i></small>
          
          <br /><br />
          <small><b>Recent news</b>: Richard Bamler, a mathematician at UC Berkeley, and Bruce Kleiner of NYU have proved the multiplicity-one conjecture. Their work not only advances the understanding of mean curvature flow but also holds significant potential for applications across geometry and topology. </small>
          <br /><br />
          <small><b>Currently reading</b>: <i>A Pale View of Hills</i> by Kazuo Ishiguro, and <i>A People's History of the United States</i> by Howard Zinn.</small>
          <br /><br />
          <small><b>Currently playing</b>: <i>Carmen Fantasy, Op. 25</i>, by Pablo de Sarasate (1881), and <i>Sonata No. 3 in C major, BWV 1005</i>, by Johann Sebastian Bach.</small>
          <br /><br />
          <small><b>Recent Movies</b>: <i>Hundreds of Beavers</i> (2022 d. Mike Cheslik), and <i>Juno</i> (2007 d. Jason Reitman). </small>
          <br /><br />
          <small><b>Current Music Recs</b>: <i>Odelay</i> by Beck (<a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/1Pus5h1qGedCn4CtOuPVtp?si=5TMaPZtjQeiM_WgCF-HBRg">Spotify</a>), and <i>Live at Macalester College</i> by The Byard Lancaster Unit.
