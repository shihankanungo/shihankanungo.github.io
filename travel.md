- **San Francisco --- Jan 2**. The Dancing Yak. Went for dinner. Casual, unassuming place with very tastefully done interiors. Service was very friendly and warm. Ordered *kale chaat*, *chicken momos*, *lamb shapta*, *goat curry*, and *thali*. Everything was super yummy. Excellent experience. Will come again for sure.
