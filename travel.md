- **London, UK --- Apr 15--23**. To commemorate Project PickAxe (those who know!). Great food scene -- _Oorja_, and momos at _Darjeeling Express_. Walking around the city is fun! We saw Buckingham Palace and explored parts of Soho. The Cotswolds are magical---we had a great time there. Coming back to London, we took a boat ride, visited the _National Gallery_, and explored more of the city on foot.
- **San Francisco, CA --- May 24**. Lunch at *Papito* (steak fajitas) followed by a walk down the street and browsing in the corner bookstore, where I read the first few pages of *Mistborn* by Brandon Sanderson. We also stopped by the local convenience store and Baba and I picked up a "*La Fermi√®re Naturally French Creamy Whole Milk Rose Yogurt*" each.  
- **Chicago, IL --- Jun 8--Jul 2**. MAA's Mathematical Olympiad Program (MOP) at the *Illinois Mathematics and Science Academy* (IMSA). Reached a few days early and stayed at *Chicago Marriott Southwest at Burr Ridge* -- fantastic hotel! Our room overlooks a beautiful view with a pond within a lush green rolling meadow. Pizzas at _Stix and Stones_ were incredible. On Monday I met with Isaac at Univ. of Chicago. We also had a fabulous dinner at *Kama Bistro* -- black pepper lamb and achari chicken. I met with Arun on Tuesday at *Cupitol Coffee & Eatery*. We then had lunch at *Momo Factory*.
- **Danville, CA --- Jul 5**. To meet with **WZ** at Blackhawk Plaza.
- **Guerneville, CA --- Aug 4--8**. The drive took us 3 hours, during which we mostly listened to Taylor Swift, Miranda Lambert and dad's interstate playlist. Mom had some *interesting* questions for us, and we chatted a fair bit as well. Stayed at *The Stavrand Russian River Valley*, which served complimentary breakfast which was amazing &mdash; dad and I ordered *chilaquiles*, while mom went with the *eggs benedict*. 
- **Sacramento, CA --- Aug 8--9**. For the MAA AMC Award Ceremony at the *SAFE Credit Union Convention Center*. Honorees include the 2025 U.S. IMO and EGMO teams, the USAMO Gold winners, the Young Women in Mathematics, and the 2024 Edyth May Sliffe Award winners. MAA put us up at the *Sheraton Grand Sacramento Hotel*. The awards ceremony was excellent: the speeches were very good and it was arranged very professionally. At Mathfest, me and the other awardees were treated very specially: many people came up and introduced themselves to us. I chatted with **TZ** for a long-ish time. Persi Diaconis gave an interesting (and fun) talk on card tricks. 
We had dinner at *Zocalo's Midtown* &mdash; enchiladas for me, tacos for dad, and salmon for mom. The food was excellent and the service was beyond excellent. They even brought us a complimentary dessert at the end of the meal. Next day, mom went out and stumbled upon the Farmer's Market, which she raved about for the rest of the trip and even after reaching home.
- **Cambridge, MA --- Oct 18--20**. MIT PRIMES October Conference.
