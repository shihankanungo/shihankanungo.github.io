- **San Francisco --- Jan 2**. The Dancing Yak. Went for dinner. Casual, unassuming place with very tastefully done interiors. Service was very friendly and warm. Ordered *kale chaat*, *chicken momos*, *lamb shapta*, *goat curry*, and *thali*. Everything was super yummy. Excellent experience. Will come again for sure.
- **San Francisco --- Jan 10**. The Dancing Yak. Went for dinner (yet again). Ordered *kale chaat*, *chicken momos*, *lamb shapta*, *chicken chowmein*, *butter chicken*, and *lamb kebab*. Everything was super yummy. Excellent experience. Will come again for sure.
- **Pasadena, CA --- Jan 23--25**. Caltech Math Meet (CMM). Road trip with parents. Listened to [this playlist](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/3nuVXLEao4eoONInGsuDg7?si=deed7bae5f5e4c4b) on the way to Pasadena and [this other one](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/32wdIEm5MTG3QZCevX4Fcq?si=e50e484fb3164f14) on the way back home. The drive was beautiful both ways, the landscape green instead of desert sand and parched earth. Stayed in *Pasadena Rose and Crown Hotel*, which was very comfortable and functional. Got *Din Tai Fung* for dinner Friday and *Cava* on Saturday. The contest itself was quite good &mdash; we got 1st place in power, 1st place in team and 1st place overall.
