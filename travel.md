- **San Francisco --- Jan 2**. The Dancing Yak. Went for dinner. Casual, unassuming place with very tastefully done interiors. Service was very friendly and warm. Ordered *kale chaat*, *chicken momos*, *lamb shapta*, *goat curry*, and *thali*. Everything was super yummy. Excellent experience. Will come again for sure.
- **San Francisco --- Jan 10**. The Dancing Yak. Went for dinner (yet again). Ordered *kale chaat*, *chicken momos*, *lamb shapta*, *chicken chowmein*, *butter chicken*, and *lamb kebab*. Everything was super yummy. Excellent experience. Will come again for sure.
- **Pasadena, CA --- Jan 23--25**. Caltech Math Meet (CMM). Road trip with my parents. Listened to [this playlist](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/3nuVXLEao4eoONInGsuDg7?si=deed7bae5f5e4c4b) on the drive to Pasadena and [this other one](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/32wdIEm5MTG3QZCevX4Fcq?si=e50e484fb3164f14) on the way back. The drive was beautiful in both directions &mdash; the landscape lush and green instead of desert sand and parched earth. There were several moments that reminded us of *the Cotswolds*. We stayed at the *Pasadena Rose and Crown Hotel*, which was very comfortable and functional. Had *Din Tai Fung* for dinner on Friday and *Cava* on Saturday. The contest itself went really well &mdash; we took 1st place in power, 1st place in team, and 1st place overall.
- **Cambridge, MA --- Feb 13--15**. Harvard-MIT Math Tournament (HMMT Feb). It was cold in Boston when we arrived &mdash; plenty of snow by the side of the road and on rooftops (though the roads were dry). Dinner from *Spice Delight* on Friday was yummy. Contest was meh; we (AlphaStar AIR) came 4th. Met lots of friends during the contest. Had *CAVA* for dinner on Saturday. Also got *Royce chocolates*, as always. 
- **Bucharest, Romania --- Feb 20--28**. The 17th Romanian Master in Mathematics, RMM 2026.
